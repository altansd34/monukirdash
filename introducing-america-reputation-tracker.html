In brief, when America’s reputation dims among overseas consumers, so too does the luster of American brands.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The impact of Donald Trump’s election to the presidency in November 2016 on views of the United States and of American companies — inferred from trade patterns — is similarly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>well documented</a>.

Amid this challenging backdrop, U.S. companies would be wise to devote additional resources to managing the risks — and in some cases, opportunities — linked to shifting global views of America.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-headline3 leading-headline3 mb-m"><strong>Tracking geopolitical risks to, and opportunities arising from, America’s global brand</strong></h3><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To assist companies in doing so, Morning Consult has launched a global <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>U.S. Reputation Tracker</a>. The tracker leverages our daily survey data to provide country-specific, regional, and global metrics of America’s reputation — including GDP- and population-weighted metrics — among overseas consumers and residents of supply chain host countries in 42 global markets covered by <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult Intelligence</a>, with historical coverage of nearly four years.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Across all countries and metrics featured in the tracker, we measure U.S. reputation as net favorability toward the United States, defined as the share of consumers holding favorable views of America minus the share holding unfavorable views. The tracker reports these data points on a monthly basis. For clients seeking higher frequency metrics of America’s reputation, the favorability data underlying the tracker is available across 42 markets on a daily basis via <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult Intelligence</a>. Additional methodological details can be found <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>here</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In addition to measuring U.S. reputation globally, the tracker also provides sector-specific assessments of “country affinity,” defined as the strength of the relationship between views of America and views of U.S. companies, derived from global sentiment toward a blinded basket of major U.S. multinationals available via <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult Intelligence</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The tracker’s primary use-case is to facilitate corporate risk management and scenario planning efforts by enabling brands to identify (1) markets where unfavorable views of America pose a heightened risk of worsening brand reputation; (2) markets where favorable views of America offer revenue and supply chain opportunities; and (3) the sectors most exposed to these effects, whether positive or negative. Firm-specific analysis is possible using Morning Consult Intelligence data on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-headline3 leading-headline3 mb-m"><strong>The biggest risks on the horizon</strong></h3><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Per the past several years of our U.S. reputation tracking data, Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House in 2025 (and its implications for both global trade policy and the war in Ukraine), a worsening of the Israel-Hamas War, and increasingly strained U.S.-China relations are among the three most pressing geopolitical threats to America’s reputation overseas and, by extension, to those of U.S. brands. We address each in turn.</p><h3 class="font-semibold text-headline3 leading-headline3 mb-m"><i>1. A second Trump presidency</i></h3><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The final months of the Trump presidency saw America’s global reputation solidly underwater on an unweighted and GDP-weighted basis — and nearly underwater on a population-weighted basis — among consumers in a core set of overseas markets where our tracking data history is the longest (markets include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the United Kingdom). In the year-long period following Joe Biden’s inauguration in January 2021, America’s reputation rebounded sharply, rising by approximately 20-30 points on a net basis across the three metrics we examine (see leftmost portion of chart below). No other single event in the history of our data has had such a profound impact on America’s reputation among overseas consumers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX567tb7OnaycoZ6ceqK5xKugnJldp7KxwdOaq6KnnmLBs63CpJyr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
