This posed a&nbsp;big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenge</a> for the people in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;the show because, in&nbsp;the previous season, <strong>Bernadette character and her husband already had a&nbsp;child.</strong> But the show’s creators thought it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;an&nbsp;exciting story. Bernadette’s husband, Howard, was amazed to&nbsp;hear that she was expecting their second baby so&nbsp;soon after their first one, who hadn’t even turned one year old yet.</p><p>“They’re shell-shocked at&nbsp;the beginning,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> the show’s creator. “They’re still coming to&nbsp;terms with having a&nbsp;first child in&nbsp;the house, so&nbsp;having a&nbsp;second child has really knocked them for a&nbsp;loop. Some of&nbsp;the same things from the first time around, too, like Bernadette, who is&nbsp;very driven at&nbsp;work and took some time off to&nbsp;have the first baby and has just gotten back, will now have to&nbsp;take time off again.

The team of&nbsp;<i>Avengers: Age of&nbsp;Ultron faced</i> the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenge</a> of&nbsp;hiding the actress’s pregnancy in&nbsp;the movie. Ultimately, they managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;without cutting out any scenes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a98/47e/e4b12354e887f2f5a0ccd7f4b1.png><p>This happened thanks to&nbsp;three Natasha Romanoff stunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a>, various close-up scenes, concealing costumes, shooting from special angles, and even additional visual effects.</p><p><h2><i>Alias</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b5/ac6/3aa5455c5691c961206f173dd5.jpg><p>Upon discovering <a href=# title="Jennifer Garner" data-link=tag>Jennifer Garner</a>’s pregnancy while she was in&nbsp;the lead role, the scriptwriters faced the task of&nbsp;entirely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reworking</a> season 5. This time, Sydney Bristow was preparing for motherhood, which meant they didn’t need to&nbsp;conceal her growing baby bump.</p><p>Nonetheless, as&nbsp;the actress reached the later stages of&nbsp;pregnancy, she could no&nbsp;longer partake in&nbsp;demanding action sequences. <strong>To&nbsp;address this, they introduced Rachael into the storyline—a fresh-faced special agent—where Sydney assumed a&nbsp;supervisory role.</strong> This clever adjustment allowed Rachael to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;thrilling escapades while Sydney could savor her pregnancy within a&nbsp;more peaceful setting.</p><p><h2><i>Once Upon a&nbsp;Time</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c3/415/81e32b5af08165864b33725e63.jpg><p>During the making of&nbsp;the 3rd season of&nbsp;the show, Ginnifer Goodwin, who portrayed Snow White, shared her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a> news. However, the creators of&nbsp;the series swiftly devised a&nbsp;solution. This led to&nbsp;Snow White and Prince Charming expecting a&nbsp;baby within the storyline.</p><p>Interestingly, the actress’s real-life romantic connection with her future <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spouse</a> and the father of&nbsp;the baby, who coincidentally portrayed Prince Charming, adds an&nbsp;extra layer of&nbsp;fairy-tale charm to&nbsp;the scenario.</p><p><h2><i>Desperate Housewives</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e46/b0f/f1ed8d5efd893d3c7a1826ec8a.jpg><p>Actress Marcia Cross experienced a&nbsp;surprise when she became pregnant with twins at&nbsp;44. This posed a&nbsp;challenge since a&nbsp;pregnancy storyline for her character, Bree, didn’t align with the series’ existing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plots</a>, all of&nbsp;which were already planned. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the show’s creators needed to&nbsp;devise clever ways to&nbsp;hide her growing baby bump. This led to&nbsp;Bree wearing more sweaters and focusing on&nbsp;close-up shots. In&nbsp;one particular episode, <strong>they even employed a&nbsp;gingerbread house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;prop to&nbsp;disguise her tummy.</strong></p><p>Interestingly, Marcia Cross had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>depict</a> a&nbsp;pregnant character in&nbsp;the series after giving birth. Her character used a&nbsp;pillow under her clothing to&nbsp;pretend that the baby her daughter was expecting belonged to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>Wonder Woman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70d/8ac/1ab8b754228d0ff1eca87e9b27.jpg><p><a href=# title="Gal Gadot" data-link=tag>Gal Gadot</a> decided that she wanted to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conceal</a> the fact that she was pregnant while shooting <i>Wonder Woman.</i> This was done because she did not want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated differently than other actors on&nbsp;set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9fe/076/e228c456eda34d0a0d54db1812.png><p>It&nbsp;was challenging to&nbsp;do, as&nbsp;she was affected by&nbsp;migraines and vomiting. But the film became a&nbsp;huge sensation thanks to&nbsp;her efforts, talent, and support from the shooting team.</p><p><h2><i>The Witches</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08e/462/2267645403a010980ca02fb238.jpg><p>During the production of&nbsp;this film, <a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a> found herself expecting a&nbsp;child. Upon discovering that the wardrobe was being prepared for the character Grand High Witch, Hathaway expressed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concerns</a> about feeling uncomfortable if&nbsp;the outfits were too snug around the waist. This led to&nbsp;avoiding<strong> using costumes with narrow waistlines, despite causing some disappointment for the costume designer.</strong> Ultimately, the decision was made to&nbsp;wear clothing that provided more room to&nbsp;move.</p><p>The primary challenge for the wardrobe team revolved around a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purple</a> <a href=# title=dress data-link=tag>dress</a> adorned with a&nbsp;golden snake. The actress’s pregnancy had become noticeable by&nbsp;then, necessitating a&nbsp;substantial dress redesign.</p><p><h2><i>Bones</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/877/0a3/3d4307561a84d28abe2294dc08.jpg><p>Emily Deschanel, known for her role in&nbsp;the series <i><a href=# title=Bones data-link=tag>Bones</a></i>, along with her on-screen persona Temperance Brennan, experienced pregnancies during the initial part of&nbsp;Season&nbsp;7. Yet, the actress gave birth to&nbsp;her real-life baby a&nbsp;bit earlier than her character’s timeline. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>result</a>, <strong>Deschanel had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;prosthetic belly for a&nbsp;scene after her own delivery.</strong> She shared that it&nbsp;was pretty uncomfortable and warm to&nbsp;move around with it&nbsp;on.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tried</a> on&nbsp;several artificial tummies designed for various celebrities to&nbsp;find the most fitting belly. Emily even tested the belly bump originally crafted for <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> among these. Nonetheless, she mentioned not recalling which belly bump she ultimately settled&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2><i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d25/477/8b5e50568cb39f2a50fdbd90a6.jpg><p>During her tenure on&nbsp;the set, Caterina Scorsone, renowned for portraying Dr. Amelia Shepherd in&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> and its derivative, Private Practice, experienced pregnancy on&nbsp;three occasions. Interestingly, her initial and third instances of&nbsp;being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnant</a> were seamlessly woven into the narrative. Paradoxically, the character Dr. Amelia Shepherd suffered a&nbsp;tragic loss during her first on-screen pregnancy. Consequently, upon discovering the actress’s subsequent pregnancy, the show’s creators opted to&nbsp;provide her character an&nbsp;opportunity for maternal bliss in&nbsp;alignment with the storyline.</p><p><h2><i>Jack Reacher</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ade/824/47c7b559ada237649216e72fc2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the thriller <i>Jack Reacher</i>, a&nbsp;decision was made to&nbsp;keep the actress’s pregnancy hidden from the audience. This became more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>complex</a> due to&nbsp;the storyline’s brief duration of&nbsp;3&nbsp;days, contrasted with the filming process spanning 4&nbsp;months. This necessitated the collaboration of&nbsp;costume designers and cameramen to&nbsp;ensure Rosamund Pike’s consistent appearance on&nbsp;screen and attempt to&nbsp;obscure her growing baby bump. To&nbsp;achieve this, the actress frequently wore dark-colored attire during filming.</p><p>Interestingly, Rosamund Pike herself believes that the presence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;few extra pounds during filming made<strong> the character more believable and relatable. </strong>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;actually really like how&nbsp;I look because I&nbsp;am carrying a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;weight.”</p><p><h2><i>The Office</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/686/58e/2a24e956f3bd6e3d7b9dcb25ff.jpg><p>While the actress portraying the lead character Pam, Jenna Fischer, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expecting</a> her first child, her on-screen husband, and she already had a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;the storyline. This made the actress worried about addressing her sensitive condition, and she requested the costume designers to&nbsp;purchase new outfits that could conceal her growing baby bump from curious gazes. Nevertheless, when keeping it&nbsp;under wraps any longer became difficult, Jenna came clean about her pregnancy. Subsequently, a&nbsp;decision was made to&nbsp;organically incorporate her pregnancy into the show by&nbsp;having the on-screen couple welcome a&nbsp;second child.</p><p><h2><i>The Vampire Diaries</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85f/cf1/81851357258c3ecaa5fed90e8d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the seventh season, the vampire character Caroline, portrayed by&nbsp;Candice King, found herself expecting... thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;magical assistance. She embraced the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surrogate mother</a> carrying twins through a&nbsp;mystical transformation. According to&nbsp;the show’s producer, they crafted a&nbsp;tale involving a&nbsp;woman who arrived at&nbsp;the doorstep of&nbsp;a&nbsp;grieving widower and revealed, “I&nbsp;believe I’m carrying your children.” However, it&nbsp;was evident that this narrative turn was rather abrupt, which wasn’t part of&nbsp;the plan until Candice King called to&nbsp;share her pregnancy news.</p><p>Despite her genuine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a>, the actress had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;prosthetic belly on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;her own. This adjustment was necessary because her character was anticipating twins, <strong>while Candice was expecting only one baby and didn’t appear “pregnant enough” for the role.</strong> Beyond this, the unexpected plot twist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paved</a> the way for spin-off series like <i>The Originals and Legacies</i>.</p><p>Crazy and unexpected plot twists in&nbsp;movies always bring&nbsp;us excitement and joy.
