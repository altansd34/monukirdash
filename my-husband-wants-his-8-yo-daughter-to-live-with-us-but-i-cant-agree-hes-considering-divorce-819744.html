Stella and her husband Paul were both very happy in their second marriage.
My mother had 4 children from her previous marriage (man was a monster) and by the time my dad passed, when I was 20 (siblings were 34, 36, 38 and 41) they hadn't spoken to their bio-monster in close to my lifetime and &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We never used the word half anything. Unfortunately, they are all gone now, but they will forever be my bros and sis'.</p><p>Stella, 39, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who has accomplished a&nbsp;great deal in&nbsp;her life. She holds a&nbsp;high-paying and fulfilling job, having progressed from being a&nbsp;nurse to&nbsp;the chief doctor of&nbsp;cardiology. While she is&nbsp;happy in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> and could easily enjoy her life, a&nbsp;problem within her newly formed family is&nbsp;preventing her from living normally.</p><p>Stella shared her family story to&nbsp;explain why she had to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;tough decision, which has led to&nbsp;constant fights and misunderstandings with her husband, Paul. She is&nbsp;seeking our readers’ opinions on&nbsp;this controversial issue and hopes to&nbsp;receive advice from those who might have faced similar situations.</p><p>In&nbsp;her letter, Stella wrote, “I’ve been married to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband Paul for over three years now. This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;second marriage, and the same goes for Paul. We’re quite happy in&nbsp;our relationship because it’s mature, stable, and transparent. We&nbsp;both have worked hard to&nbsp;achieve the level of&nbsp;mutual understanding and trust that we&nbsp;now enjoy in&nbsp;our family. Everything seemed good so&nbsp;far, but there’s a&nbsp;problem that prevents&nbsp;us from moving forward in&nbsp;our happy marriage. And this problem is&nbsp;Paul’s expectations of&nbsp;me&nbsp;regarding his child, Ella.”</p><p><h2>Paul has a&nbsp;daughter from his previous marriage, and Stella has been treating her kindly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c8/29f/6c68b75c92abbc71e17868d575.jpg><p>Stella shared, “Paul has a&nbsp;daughter, Ella, from his previous marriage. She is&nbsp;8&nbsp;years old. From the start of&nbsp;our relationship, Paul was upfront about having a&nbsp;child. He&nbsp;has Ella every other weekend, and I’ve always told him that’s fine with&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;can spend as&nbsp;much time with her as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants, and&nbsp;I won’t have an&nbsp;issue. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;include me&nbsp;in&nbsp;their activities, I&nbsp;was always happy to&nbsp;join.”</p><p>Stella continued, “However, I&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband that I&nbsp;am not Ella’s parent; that’s a&nbsp;role for him and his ex-wife. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;would take care of&nbsp;her if&nbsp;she was left with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;never ignored her—I cooked for her, and if&nbsp;she wanted to&nbsp;talk or&nbsp;play, I&nbsp;gladly did that too. But I&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;a&nbsp;parental role. I&nbsp;was very clear about that. If&nbsp;Ella did something that needed discipline, for instance, I&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;the one to&nbsp;ground or&nbsp;punish her. That’s a&nbsp;parent’s responsibility, which I&nbsp;am not.”</p><p><h2>Tension suddenly arose within the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d6/c29/bca55955359443c0790ddd783d.jpg><p>Stella explained, “Ten months ago, Paul lost his job and couldn’t find a&nbsp;new one quickly, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;got evicted from the apartment he&nbsp;had been living in&nbsp;before we&nbsp;moved in&nbsp;together. He&nbsp;kept that apartment even after we&nbsp;got married, and we&nbsp;both thought it&nbsp;was fine. I&nbsp;have my&nbsp;own house, and&nbsp;I lived there, while Paul stayed in&nbsp;his apartment and worked from there. This was the arrangement we&nbsp;agreed upon, and it&nbsp;worked well for&nbsp;us. But after he&nbsp;lost his apartment, I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;could move in&nbsp;with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;even set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;spare room as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bedroom for Ella, so&nbsp;she’d have a&nbsp;comfortable place when she stayed with&nbsp;us. Everything was going smoothly until last week when Paul sat me&nbsp;down for a&nbsp;serious talk. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that his ex-wife found out about his new living situation and suggested that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better for Ella to&nbsp;live with&nbsp;us full-time, visiting her mother twice a&nbsp;month.”</p><p>Stella was taken aback by&nbsp;this news. She shared, “I&nbsp;was absolutely furious, and you can probably understand why. Without consulting me&nbsp;first, my&nbsp;husband had already agreed to&nbsp;this arrangement and presented it&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were great news. He&nbsp;said, ’Honey, please be&nbsp;happy! Our little girl will be&nbsp;with&nbsp;us full-time now,’ to&nbsp;which&nbsp;I laughed because&nbsp;I thought he&nbsp;was joking. Unfortunately, Paul wasn’t joking. I&nbsp;immediately told him&nbsp;I was not okay with it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. Even though&nbsp;I don’t work from home, I&nbsp;never wanted kids, and that hasn’t changed. Paul understood and accepted this from the beginning.”</p><p><h2>Stella was upset about her husband’s request and has openly shared her concerns.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9c/e2e/3e3e1a5341b50d3dbe5bcd2dcb.jpg><p>Stella continued, “After that shocking conversation, Paul and&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;sit down with his ex-wife to&nbsp;discuss the situation. We&nbsp;hoped that by&nbsp;talking things through, we&nbsp;could find a&nbsp;solution that worked for everyone. However, when we&nbsp;met with her, she was adamant about her decision. She insisted that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better for Ella to&nbsp;live with&nbsp;us full-time, especially considering Paul’s new living arrangement.”</p><p>“Despite our efforts, she didn’t budge. Paul seemed caught in&nbsp;the middle, trying to&nbsp;appease both sides, but it&nbsp;was clear his ex-wife was set on&nbsp;her decision. I&nbsp;felt frustrated and unheard. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;told her, ’I’m not opposed to&nbsp;Ella spending more time with&nbsp;us, but making this decision without involving me&nbsp;isn’t fair.’</p><p>The meeting ended without any agreement, and&nbsp;I was left feeling more confused and upset. It&nbsp;was clear that Paul’s ex-wife wasn’t going to&nbsp;change her mind, and Paul seemed unsure of&nbsp;how to&nbsp;navigate this new dynamic. I&nbsp;told him afterward, ’We need to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutual agreement that considers everyone’s feelings and needs, not just make unilateral decisions.’”</p><p>Stella concluded her letter by&nbsp;saying, “I’m reaching out to&nbsp;hear your thoughts and advice on&nbsp;this situation. How do&nbsp;we&nbsp;move forward from here? How can we&nbsp;find a&nbsp;balance that respects everyone involved?”</p><p>Here’s a&nbsp;story about a&nbsp;woman who no&nbsp;longer wants her pregnant daughter and six grandchildren living in&nbsp;her home. She decides to&nbsp;kick them out and feels no&nbsp;remorse about&nbsp;it. <a href=#><strong>Read on</strong></a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand why she felt compelled to&nbsp;make such a&nbsp;drastic choice regarding her daughter and her soon-to-be-born grandchild.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6uK3NrapmoJmoenl52KhknZmlnLW1sdFmq6hlnJ7DpnnWoquhZaWoeqPB02agZpuRo8FurcarnJ5lmJrAbq%2FOp6qinJWntq%2BzjJ2gr6eimLJuhJBybm1sXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
