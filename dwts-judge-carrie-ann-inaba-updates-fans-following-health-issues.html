She shared that she’s been dealing with “health situation after health situation” over the past several months.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carrie-ann-inaba-updates-fans-on-her-health>Carrie Ann Inaba Updates Fans on Her Health</h2><p>In December, Inaba shared that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she had fractured her rib</a> while building furniture. As it turns out, that was only the start of several medical issues she’s had to deal with this year. She shared updates during a recent Instagram live video.</p><p>Inaba explained that after her rib “finally healed,” she became sick with Covid-19. This experience was “a lot harder than I realized,” as she had “some PTSD that came out with it” from the last time she caught the virus. Inaba said she “was a little bit depressed.”</p><p>After that, the judge said she started getting stomach flus and eventually had to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have her appendix removed</a> back in March. Inaba explained that she has “a little bit of a belly, which is part of the healing process.”</p><p>She thanked fans for the messages of support they shared when she posted about her appendectomy earlier this year. Inaba said she’ll be posting more and “trying to share some really positive things.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CARRIE ANN INABA SHARES MESSAGE OF OPTIMISM AHEAD OF ‘DWTS’ SEASON 32</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inaba-is-excited-about-season-32>Inaba Is Excited About Season 32</h2><p>During her live video, Inaba also spoke positively about the upcoming Season 32 of Dancing with the Stars. She said she was glad the show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would be airing on ABC</a> as well as Disney+, calling it “the best of both worlds.”</p><p>Inaba also expressed excitement that former pro dancer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julianne Hough will be back</a> on the show to co-host with Alfonso Ribeiro. She called Hough her “little sister.” Hough commented on the video later with three red heart emojis.</p><p>In the caption of her video, Inaba told fans that she’s back, writing that “the human spirit is very resilient” and “the body is always trying to find its way to healing.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_Heidi_Sofia_Final-220x147.jpg alt="5 Times Heidi Klum, Sofia Vergara Have Proven They Are Ultimate Besties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>carrie ann inaba</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWaqrGosYycmKuqmZp6orrNZqCnmZKWera8w5qrnqtdm66vv4yfpqWkn6y2r7OMoZyapKSdeqq%2F0q6crGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
