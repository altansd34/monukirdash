Being an&nbsp;ardent fan of&nbsp;Depp’s portrayal of&nbsp;Captain Jack Sparrow in&nbsp;the <i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean</i> franchise, Stovell, who had undergone two heart transplants, expressed his wish to&nbsp;meet Depp and asked the renowned actor to&nbsp;subscribe to&nbsp;his YouTube channel, <i>“Kraken the Box.”</i> During their virtual meeting, Depp affectionately dubbed Stovell “Captain Kori” and promised to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;follower of&nbsp;the young child’s YouTube channel.</p><p><h2>Kori was a&nbsp;huge fan of&nbsp;Jack Sparrow.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7f/58f/4528ac512b9f2f7e4a7551a6c0.jpg><p>So&nbsp;after meeting with Johnny Depp online, the boy shared a&nbsp;special <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> featuring the beloved Hollywood star in&nbsp;his cherished Pirates character. In&nbsp;the footage, Depp’s Captain Jack can be&nbsp;heard saying, “So, Capt. Kori, terribly sorry&nbsp;I missed out on&nbsp;this. Meant to&nbsp;say&nbsp;it, forgot to&nbsp;say&nbsp;it, didn’t say&nbsp;it, gonna say it&nbsp;now. Saying it, I’ll say&nbsp;it.</p><p>I&nbsp;hear tell of&nbsp;something they speak about in&nbsp;the ages of&nbsp;now called the YouTube channel, which&nbsp;I don’t understand, but why not?...</p><p>I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;will make for a&nbsp;wonderful entertainment expertise momentary lapse of&nbsp;togetherness altogether in&nbsp;one space, but far apart, but then, at&nbsp;the same time, very close. Curious, enduring and strange.”</p><p>The source <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> Kori was a&nbsp;huge fan of&nbsp;Jack Sparrow, frequently watching the Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean movies “during his multiple heart surgeries and subsequent recovery periods.”</p><p><h2>The actor also paid tribute when Kori passed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c21/793/f1fef652b6a4fd58884b175f19.jpg><p>Tragically, one magazine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> the devastating news of&nbsp;“Captain Kori’s” passing, as&nbsp;both of&nbsp;his attempted heart transplants proved unsuccessful. In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;this heartbreaking update, Johnny Depp expressed his condolences and paid tribute to&nbsp;Kori on&nbsp;social media. Declaring himself as&nbsp;Kori’s biggest fan, Depp took to&nbsp;Instagram and shared a&nbsp;heartfelt message that undoubtedly honors the memory of&nbsp;“Captain Kori”:</p><p>“Sail&nbsp;on, my&nbsp;fellow captain!! You honored&nbsp;us with your life. You humbled and amazed&nbsp;us with the courage and strength to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;smile through it&nbsp;all. You’ve shown&nbsp;us how to&nbsp;stay ahead of&nbsp;the curve with grace, humor, incomprehensible understanding, and unparalleled dignity. You are a&nbsp;warrior, mate...we will meet again on&nbsp;the highest of&nbsp;seas...all my&nbsp;love and respect to&nbsp;you and your family always!!! X&nbsp;JD. ”</p><p>Although many people remain fans of&nbsp;Captain Jack Sparrow, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>confirmed</a> that Johnny Depp has completely cut ties with Disney. The reason for this decision stems from his deep resentment towards the studio, as&nbsp;they terminated his contract abruptly during his legal dispute with his ex-wife, Amber Heard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLewtM2nsGaclaW9brLUpZ2ipJyasW7Ax55krZ2ioravrculsGahnKF6pLTIpZusZZyWwLV51qKqoWWSrnq0sc2doKefXZ22rnnAZqSeq6OWtKZ5wKxknJmgqa6quoyjmJyjXai9or7RqK5mcGFpf3R8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
