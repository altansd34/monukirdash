While 48% had “strongly” supported this in mid-2020, this has since risen to 61%. Overall support has risen from 77% to 84%, while opposition remains about the same, at 6% (from 7%).</p><p data-block-key=788pt>The large majority continue to support being able to see the video footage the video assistant referees are being shown at the same time they are being shown it (86%), encouraging the on-field referee to consult pitch-side VAR screens (69%) and a time limit on how long it can take for decisions to be made using VAR (65%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLG70a1mmqqknrCtsdJoa3BsZ2x6t63RZqernZ2esrN5y56YoK2VYsSiwMKhnKurXaiuunnIrapmq6Seua151qippKGenHqjrcOlsGaZnpl6rq3KoqWgZZeWuqa%2FjKWcrKtdmruru9iamaWdXam8bsPArZqh</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
