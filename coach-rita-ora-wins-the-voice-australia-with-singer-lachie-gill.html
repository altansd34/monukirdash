The singer turned all four coaches’ chairs for the performance, with Ora the first to hit her button.</p><p>Ora blocked fellow coach Guy Sebastian from getting Lachie on his team. The singer ended up choosing her as his coach, and he went on to win the Callback and Battle rounds. In the Semifinals, he was saved by Ora to go to the finale.</p><p>For his final chance at the title, Lachie performed “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper and teamed up with Ora on a duet of “Always Remember Us This Way” by Lady Gaga. Lachie wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> that it was a “privilege” to share the stage with Ora, calling it “a moment I will never forget.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>HOW JUDGING ‘THE VOICE’ IS A FULL CIRCLE MOMENT FOR POP STAR RITA ORA</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lachie-drops-original-single-wasted-time>Lachie Drops Original Single ‘Wasted Time’</h2><p>Lachie has released an original winner’s single called “Wasted Time,” available to stream now. The single currently sits at No. 40 on the Australian iTunes Top 100 chart. The singer shared an <a href=#>Instagram video</a> after his win expressing his gratitude and calling this season of The Voice Australia “nothing short of amazing.”</p><p>Since winning the series, finalist Faith Sosene has created waves in The Voice AU community, implying that Lachie took home the prize because he’s a “<a href=# class=broken_link>white boy</a>.” Instead of replying directly to the controversial statements, Lachie chose to share his love for the other finalists.</p><p>The other finalists this season were Faith (on Jessica Mauboy’s team), Thando Sikwila (on Keith Urban’s team), and Jordan Tavita (on Guy Sebastian’s team). Original songs by finalists are now available for streaming.</p><p>This was Ora’s second season as a coach on The Voice, having joined the show for Season 10 in 2021. Last season, she brought girl group G-Nat!on to the finale, which was won by Bella Taylor Smith on Sebastian’s team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1395462033.jpg alt="Derek Hough is Engaged to Hayley Erbert After Nearly 7 Years of Dating" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rita ora</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice Australia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqiYnKBdp7a1rYyoqZplp567tHnToZxmrp%2BesKZ5wK6qraqRobaiedaiq6Flo567qLHRZqOam5iesm6zyKWjaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
