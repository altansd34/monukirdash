When the song selection seemed to be the reason why the fan favorite was sent home early during the quarterfinals, backlash ensued. With a huge fan-base, many were left confused and <a href=#>theories</a> began to form about who would choose a song that the judges would go on and deem “too mature” for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Charlotte could have been considered a seasoned professional. Before reaching the America’s Got Talent stage, she had already appeared on several talent shows. She first rose to fame after competing on the talent show series La Voz Kids. Charlotte also won the ‘Big Talent Marbella’ competition in Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>The young star also performed twice on NBC’s ‘Little Big Shots,’ and won an international award for her song ‘Unicorn.’&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charlotte-summers-to-perform-at-georgia-music-festival>Charlotte Summers to Perform at Georgia Music Festival</h2><p>Although many viewers watched and agonized over Charlotte’s dismissal, the singer continued to pursue her dreams after elimination. Charlotte created her YouTube channel and has amassed over 100,000 subscribers so far.</p><p>On her page, she performs sultry covers of some of today’s biggest stars including Billie Ellish, <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a>, and Rihanna. Charlotte’s ‘Unicorn’ video has garnered close to half a million views.&nbsp;Recently she shared some exciting news to her <a href=#>social media</a> followers:&nbsp;</p><p>“Hi Everyone!!! Here we come again America!!! I am delighted to tell you that very soon I will be in my second home, America! It has been a very difficult time these past two years for all of us and I’m very grateful with life. I can now tell you that I have been invited to the Downtown Music Fest 2022 in Augusta, Georgia. I can’t wait to see you all there.”</p><p>Charlotte headlining a music festival that boosts the next generation of music stars shows the perseverance of her spirit. Since leaving AGT, Charlotte has toured small festivals throughout Spain, but will now return to the U.S.</p><p>With so much on her plate leading into 2022, you can be sure that the judge’s comments haven’t stopped this rising star. You can listen to more of Charlotte’s music on her YouTube Channel or by heading to her website.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/161412_2306-e1639166267349.jpg alt="You Wanna Be On Top?
