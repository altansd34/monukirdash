While last week 38% of 18-24 year olds had been avoiding crowded places, this has now fallen to 26%. This compared to a more modest drop among 25-49 year olds (from 47% to 42%) and little to no change among those aged 50 and above.</p><p>With young people less likely to be fully vaccinated (21% according to our latest tracker data), and <a href=#>more likely to have disabled their NHS COVID-19 app</a>, the results highlight the increased risk young people are putting themselves – and others – in.</p><h3>Opening England up hasn’t helped the government’s approval rating</h3><p>While the government might have been hoping that letting people get a step closer to normal life once again would improve their image, the opposite is true. The proportion of Britons thinking the government is handling COVID-19 well has fallen from 41% just before Freedom Day to 34% afterwards.</p><p>More concerning for the government are attitudes among Conservative voters, which tumbled 17pts this week. Prior to 19 July, three quarters (73%) of Conservative voters thought the government was doing a good job of managing the pandemic response. Now only 56% do, the lowest to date among Tory voters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxvYWx%2FbrnArKJmraOaeqK5zqeeZmloYn91ediemKtln6GxtHnSpaymqKNis7C4y6iuoqaXYrOz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
