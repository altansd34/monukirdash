But even if&nbsp;you are not this type of&nbsp;person and you know that, statistically, flying is&nbsp;safer than driving, some things on&nbsp;planes (for example, turbulence or&nbsp;a&nbsp;holding pattern) can make you doubt that. We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find out which of&nbsp;these things are absolutely normal and which could be&nbsp;really dangerous.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> will tell you why you shouldn’t be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;strange noises, turbulence, flashes, and other things on&nbsp;planes.</p><p><h2>Turbulence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61d/2cd/d99a8f5dfea4ea5a4c70321686.jpg><p>All passengers have probably experienced turbulence. This is&nbsp;when the plane starts shaking, sometimes just a&nbsp;little and sometimes a&nbsp;lot. In&nbsp;this situation, it’s okay to&nbsp;feel scared, but you should remember that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>turbulence</a> is&nbsp;perfectly normal, and there’s no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;panic.</p><p>Turbulence is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;temperatures of&nbsp;ascending and descending air, especially over water, mountains, or&nbsp;airflow from a&nbsp;different plane (this often happens near airports). But there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;be&nbsp;scared that the aircraft will fall or&nbsp;break down: it&nbsp;was designed for these conditions.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, pilots try to&nbsp;avoid storm clouds and always warn passengers about the upcoming turbulence so&nbsp;that everyone has enough time to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;their seats and fasten their seatbelts. But sometimes, there are situations in&nbsp;which turbulence starts unexpectedly. We&nbsp;will tell you more about this at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article.</p><p><h2>Flashing light in&nbsp;the window</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc4/2fa/e7e88e58edb2d6667c2702e654.jpg><p>Some passengers are scared by&nbsp;flashes of&nbsp;light in&nbsp;the windows, but in&nbsp;fact there is&nbsp;nothing scary about this. They are the flashing lights on&nbsp;the tips of&nbsp;the wings that, together, with other <a href=#>navigation lights</a> are supposed to&nbsp;prevent aircraft crashes, especially near airports.</p><p>This light often reflects from clouds creating the illusion of&nbsp;lightning which is&nbsp;unnerving for many passengers even though there is&nbsp;nothing dangerous about this. By&nbsp;the way, real <a href=#>bolts of&nbsp;lightning</a> sometimes strike planes, but this is&nbsp;completely safe for modern models because they are designed for these situations.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;protect the plane from bolts of&nbsp;lightning, the materials covering it&nbsp;are tightly attached to&nbsp;each other, the onboard systems are protected by&nbsp;copper grids, fuel tanks are filled with inert gas in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;avoid burning, and wings have anti-static dischargers. Still, flying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;thunderstorm is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dangerous, so&nbsp;pilots always try to&nbsp;avoid storm clouds.</p><p><h2>Bending wings</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0b/58d/c2d9915ea69ffb04de2cb641ba.jpg><p>Another thing about planes that can scare an&nbsp;inexperienced passenger is&nbsp;bending wings. This is&nbsp;also not dangerous because the wings are <a href=#>flexible</a> and, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;have mentioned before, aircraft are designed to&nbsp;fly normally in&nbsp;turbulence. More than that, planes are thoroughly checked before take-off, so&nbsp;don’t be&nbsp;afraid if&nbsp;you see bending wings through the window: everything is&nbsp;okay.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;holding pattern</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/230/968/d6ddcd513c9f0040707aea7de8.jpg><p><a href=#>A&nbsp;holding pattern</a> before landing doesn’t mean that the plane has technical issues. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible that the airport is&nbsp;too busy, that there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;obstacle on&nbsp;the flight trajectory (for example, a&nbsp;flock of&nbsp;birds), or&nbsp;that a&nbsp;strong wind or&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe landing is&nbsp;impossible for some other reasons. Anyway, a&nbsp;delay is&nbsp;better than danger, so&nbsp;don’t worry&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very normal situation.</p><p><h2>Vibration, creaking, and other noises during takeoff and landing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de2/295/4ba39b575fba39999e269fe0ca.jpg><p>Most “suspicious” <a href=#>sounds</a> that planes make are usually not signs of&nbsp;an&nbsp;impending danger. They might be&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;flaps that open before landing.</p><p>A&nbsp;strange sound (as&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone swipes a&nbsp;coin on&nbsp;a&nbsp;guitar string) during steering is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the power transfer unit&nbsp;— a&nbsp;device that regulates the pressure in&nbsp;all the hydraulic systems of&nbsp;the plane.</p><p>Clanking and creaking after takeoff and before landing is&nbsp;the landing gear being stored or&nbsp;deployed. And the vibration during landing is&nbsp;a&nbsp;device that prevents sliding. By&nbsp;the way, an&nbsp;abrupt landing is&nbsp;considered normal if&nbsp;the plane lands in&nbsp;the rain because this way it’s easier to&nbsp;control the plane.</p><p>Just like all the parts of&nbsp;the plane, its landing gear and wheels are made with the consideration of&nbsp;tremendous loads. In&nbsp;the photo on&nbsp;the left, you can see the result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rough landing but thankfully the tires didn’t break (in&nbsp;modern planes, they are pumped with nitrogen), so&nbsp;everything ended well.</p><p><h2>And these things are really dangerous</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af0/004/57c899535fbc0c932301175a55.jpg><p>A&nbsp;very dangerous thing that can happen during a&nbsp;flight is&nbsp;icing in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a> with cold drops of&nbsp;water and also near the ground and on&nbsp;the runway. During icing (by&nbsp;the way, even the engines can get covered with ice) the plane becomes heavier and may become impossible to&nbsp;control.</p><p>Fortunately, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>way</a> to&nbsp;handle this situation: in&nbsp;cold <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a>, planes are covered with a&nbsp;special liquid before the flight. And if&nbsp;the icing happens in&nbsp;mid-air, the flight crew handles&nbsp;it: they enable the <a href=#>ice protection system</a> and leave the dangerous area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc7/60f/d630125d85b028a6e246fe882a.jpg><p>Other serious phenomena are thunderstorms, heavy rains, tornados, squall winds, dust storms, ash clouds from volcanos, and abnormally high or&nbsp;low temperatures. In&nbsp;these cases, flights are delayed. But what can you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;thunderstorm appears while you are already flying?</p><p>For this situation, the flight crew has an&nbsp;action plan and the plane has <a href=#>weather radar</a> that can see storm clouds. The color of&nbsp;the storm cloud on&nbsp;the radar shows how dangerous it&nbsp;is: the darker the color, the bigger the danger. Depending on&nbsp;the color, the crew makes a&nbsp;decision about whether to&nbsp;follow the original route or&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;new one that is&nbsp;safer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c79/75e/dc4ca0562e8d793a243b9fe661.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we’ve said before, the crew warns passengers about turbulence and tells them to&nbsp;fasten their seatbelts. However, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;phenomenon called <a href=#>clear-air turbulence</a>. As&nbsp;you might have understood from the name, this type of&nbsp;turbulence appears in&nbsp;seemingly clear air, so&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;predict that it’s coming even using weather radar.</p><p>But in&nbsp;this case, don’t be&nbsp;scared that a&nbsp;modern plane could just break down. Even in&nbsp;the past, these crashes were very rare. For example, in&nbsp;1964, a&nbsp;Boeing B-52 hit clear-air turbulence but it&nbsp;safely landed in&nbsp;Arkansas anyway.</p><p>The main danger of&nbsp;clear-air turbulence is&nbsp;that the passengers who weren’t in&nbsp;their seat might get injured. That’s why it’s better to&nbsp;keep your seatbelts fastened during the entire flight and when you need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet, hold on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the seats with your hands.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Do&nbsp;you know why flying from West to&nbsp;East is&nbsp;always faster?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ae/d29/a579c45bcd97b45ad6f43ae57e.jpg><p>You might have noticed this. For example, the flight from Moscow&nbsp;— Bangkok is&nbsp;50&nbsp;minutes shorter than the flight from Bangkok&nbsp;— Moscow even though it’s seemingly the same path. The difference is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the <a href=#>jet streams</a>.</p><p>Their speed at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high altitude is&nbsp;from 125 mph to&nbsp;300&nbsp;mph. The Earth rotates from West to&nbsp;East and if&nbsp;the plane flies in&nbsp;the same direction, it&nbsp;uses these jet streams, but if&nbsp;the plane flies in&nbsp;the opposite direction, they create an&nbsp;additional obstacle, slowing it&nbsp;down.</p><p>Are you scared of&nbsp;flying?
