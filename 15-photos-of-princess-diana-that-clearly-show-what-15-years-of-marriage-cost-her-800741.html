And yet, she wasn’t always able to&nbsp;hide her <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> from the lenses of&nbsp;photographers, and they captured what was really going on&nbsp;with her.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;archival photos of&nbsp;the Queen of&nbsp;People’s Hearts, where we&nbsp;saw the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly strong woman who spent 15&nbsp;years in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unhappy marriage.</p><p><h2>1. After Diana agreed to&nbsp;marry Prince Charles, she received an&nbsp;incredible amount of&nbsp;media attention. Not everyone could’ve coped with&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca2/cf5/38f4ab5e05b03f8bb7c817d7f2.jpg><p>Although Diana Spencer always communicated with the media and photographers with a&nbsp;special elegance, she didn’t get used to&nbsp;it&nbsp;right away. One time, she even burst into <a href=#>tears</a> while sitting at&nbsp;the wheel of&nbsp;her car. “I&nbsp;know it’s just a&nbsp;job they have to&nbsp;do, but sometimes I&nbsp;do wish they wouldn’t,” Lady Di&nbsp;said. This photo was taken at&nbsp;the kindergarten where she worked when she got engaged to&nbsp;Charles. The future princess looks a&nbsp;bit down.</p><p><h2>2. Diana felt coldness from her future husband even before the wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/894/b8f/26b00a5bec8534da2a8fdf5b12.jpg><p>On&nbsp;the day their engagement was announced, a&nbsp;journalist asked Charles, “Are you in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>?,” to&nbsp;which the Prince <a href=#>replied</a>: “Whatever love means.” Diana, on&nbsp;the other hand, believed it&nbsp;was imperative to&nbsp;love the person you were going to&nbsp;marry, and such ambiguous words from her future spouse hurt the young girl. The photo above shows how the heir to&nbsp;the throne nonchalantly placed his hand on&nbsp;the shoulder of&nbsp;his bride.</p><p><h2>3. Lady Di&nbsp;doubted her decision to&nbsp;marry Prince Charles after she found a&nbsp;bracelet meant for Camilla Parker-Bowles.</h2></p><p>But her sisters convinced her that the <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> <a href=#>should</a> go&nbsp;on. Diana confessed that she <a href=#>searched</a> for her rival in&nbsp;the crowd during the wedding ceremony, knowing she’d be&nbsp;there.</p><h2>4. During the honeymoon, the Princess <a href=#>saw</a> her rival in&nbsp;her dreams.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/861/711/1c7a1757d2a216f8ce3b2dd969.jpg><p>Diana doesn’t look very happy in&nbsp;this photo taken at&nbsp;Balmoral, where their honeymoon came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end. During this time, the princess felt <a href=#>down</a> because her husband preferred reading books and drawing to&nbsp;her conversations and didn’t pay enough attention to&nbsp;her. Lady Di&nbsp;did not share in&nbsp;her husband’s interests at&nbsp;all; she found it&nbsp;boring to&nbsp;discuss the works of&nbsp;the writer Laurens van der Post with Charles. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, Diana was jealous because she had found photos of&nbsp;Camilla in&nbsp;Charles’ diaries and noticed that he&nbsp;was wearing cufflinks with their common initials.</p><p><h2>5. The day before the announcement of&nbsp;her first pregnancy, the princess looked sad and tired.</h2></p><p>The day before, Diana appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pale blue chiffon dress at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gala concert at&nbsp;the Victoria and Albert Museum, where photographers captured her tired look.</p><p><h2>6. In&nbsp;1982, the couple welcomed their first baby, Prince William. But the joy of&nbsp;motherhood was marred by&nbsp;postpartum depression.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2d/11f/91a743582682275578b802c798.jpg><p>Diana would wake up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning and feel no&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;bed, her apathy was so&nbsp;strong. But instead of&nbsp;supporting her, her husband <a href=#>called</a> her “unstable,” a&nbsp;label that would follow her for years.</p><p><h2>7. The international tour of&nbsp;1983 marked the beginning of&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;their marriage.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;was during this trip that Prince Charles first <a href=#>realized</a> that the public preferred his young and beautiful wife to&nbsp;him. Diana, however, was unable to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;calm her husband’s jealousy or&nbsp;to&nbsp;fade into the background of&nbsp;people’s hearts.</p><p><h2>8. This photo taken at&nbsp;a&nbsp;banquet in&nbsp;New Zealand shows an&nbsp;unhappy-looking couple.</h2></p><p>Lady Di&nbsp;appears to&nbsp;have red eyes and a&nbsp;tired look, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she had been crying the night before. Her husband’s <a href=#>jealousy</a> seem to&nbsp;have been the cause, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the growing anxiety and a&nbsp;recurring eating disorder.</p><p><h2>9. Another photo showing how uncomfortable this trip was for Diana.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;looks like not even her luxurious dress made of&nbsp;cream silk organza pleased the princess at&nbsp;that moment.</p><p><h2>10. In&nbsp;1986, the couple began to&nbsp;seek comfort outside their marriage.</h2></p><p>Prince Charles confessed to&nbsp;his biographer that he&nbsp;<a href=#>renewed</a> his relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles in&nbsp;1986. At&nbsp;the same time, Princess Diana’s affair with Captain James Hewitt began.</p><p><h2>11. The photos show that the tension between the spouses was growing. This photo was taken during their tour of&nbsp;Canada.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4f/d55/ae516953eeac4964cb3d7ac743.jpg><p>Charles keeps his eyes down dejectedly, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;pondering something. And Diana looks forward with a&nbsp;stone-cold gaze, not noticing her husband.</p><p><h2>12. Shortly before the start of&nbsp;the divorce proceedings, in&nbsp;November 1992, Charles and Diana set off on&nbsp;a&nbsp;joint trip to&nbsp;South Korea.</h2></p><p>They both looked so&nbsp;unhappy that the British press <a href=#>nicknamed</a> them “the Glums.” In&nbsp;December of&nbsp;the same year, Prime Minister John Major announced the divorce of&nbsp;the Prince and Princess of&nbsp;Wales in&nbsp;the House of&nbsp;Commons.</p><h2>13. This photo was taken shortly before Queen Elizabeth’s speech, in&nbsp;which she <a href=#>said that</a> 1992 had been a&nbsp;terrible year, after her three children were divorced.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9a/a27/e82a0451cfa14ccf4cb1a2182a.jpg><p>Both Diana and Charles look completely devastated. The picture shows how the spouses try not to&nbsp;look each other in&nbsp;the eyes and tilt their heads in&nbsp;different directions.</p><p><h2>14. The divorce was finalized in&nbsp;August 1996.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/183/a7c/db276d56a38e8070cade90d668.jpg><p>Journalists captured the moment when Lady Di&nbsp;first appeared in&nbsp;public after the divorce. It’s known that the princess <a href=#>hoped</a> to&nbsp;save the marriage until the last minute. The photo above shows she managed to&nbsp;remain optimistic and adapt to&nbsp;her new role.</p><h2>15. After the divorce, she could no&nbsp;longer become Queen of&nbsp;England, but still <a href=#>remained</a> in&nbsp;the spotlight.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/342/429/8aeb8d5e1a9425f1f399eba76d.jpg><p>Diana was not going to&nbsp;stop engaging in&nbsp;social activities: she saw this as&nbsp;her calling. She supported victims of&nbsp;leprosy, HIV, and antipersonnel mines. By&nbsp;1997, Lady Di&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the public eye. Working with people became a&nbsp;new mission for her. She took lessons in&nbsp;public speaking and dreamed of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;ambassador of&nbsp;her country in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;use her fame for the benefit of&nbsp;humanity.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Princess Diana and her fate?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ec%2Bhpq2no2K8p3nPq6Cnm5WowG6wyJqlmmWkna61ecKlnJqqnK56tLTOsGSwoJGpenKBjLKcmqqjYrynecyaqauhkZyybq%2FOrKtmoJWnenl8j3Bramc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
