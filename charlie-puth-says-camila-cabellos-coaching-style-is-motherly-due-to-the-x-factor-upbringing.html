The Voice returns to NBC this fall, with a mid-September premiere. Fans cannot wait to meet Team Camila.</strong></p><p>The Voice recently announced which celebrities the coaches have appointed as their knockout round advisors. Within the announcement, it was revealed that Charlie Puth would return to the series once again as an advisor. For those who may not remember, Puth has appeared on The Voice seasons 11 and 16 as advisors to Alicia Keys and Adam Levine.</p><p>When asked about how their partnership came to be, Cabello acknowledged that she reached out to his team the day of. Even though it was a last minute decision, the two seem excited to show off the team.</p><p>“It’s a fun group, Camila is very good at pairing singers,” Puth <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Since the singers will be partnered for this season of The Voice, questions of upcoming collaborations always arise. At this time, the singes haven’t confirmed nor denied creating a track together in the future. Instead, they joked about the opportunity and fact that their partnership on the show could spark dating rumors.</p><p>SEE RELATED: <a href=#>FORMER FIFTH HARMONY MEMBERS CELEBRATE THE BAND’S 10TH ANNIVERSARY</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-camila-cabello-explains-how-the-x-factor-prepared-her-for-the-voice>Camila Cabello Explains How The X Factor Prepared Her for The Voice</h2><p>Cabello filled an interesting place on The Voice panel this season. It may be a coincidence, but her arrival to the series comes as American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson departed. The main similarity between the two singers is that they both competed on shows of their own before finding fame. Many believed that the prior experience gave Clarkson a step up in the competition.</p><p>“It gives me a unique, very helpful perspective because I was kind of put through the ringer so early,” Cabello said about her time on The X Factor. “Like imagine at 15 being like and now sing for America.”</p><p>While many celebrities rise to fame in their late teens or early twenties, Cabello had a different experience due to the show. Even though the singer was young, she found ways to get around her fear while competing in the show. Since she rose to fame at such a young age, Puth explained that she has a “motherly” coaching style. He noted that nobody on Team Camila is nervous, since their coach doesn’t have many nerves.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the singers picked for Team Camila this fall. The Voice returns to NBC on Monday, September 19 at 8/7c.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_MariahCarey_Dia-Dipasupil_Getty-Images.jpg alt="Mariah Carey Receives Backlash for Trying to Trademark ‘Queen of Christmas’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGYq6SZmnqxwdOhZKyZqah6pK3MoqOaZZOWr6a4y6iqZpuflrCptc2gZKysqaGybrXSZqSorJiav63FjJ2snmWkpHq1tMRmr2aekZjBsL6MrqebqpmjtKq6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
