Regardless of the state of relations and Saudi Arabia’s unpopularity among Americans, its vital role in U.S. interests makes it hard to impose boundaries on the relationship.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The tools the United States might deploy to spank the Saudis are quite limited,” said Thomas W. Lippman, former chief of The Washington Post’s Middle East bureau who has spent three decades covering Saudi Arabia. “We could cut off student visas, but who thinks that would increase our influence in the country? The Saudis are steadfast partners in trying to contain Iran; if we cut off arms sales and military training, what will we gain by that? The French will be only too ready to step in anyway. What are we going to do, embargo Saudi ports that export oil we consume? The Saudis just aren’t particularly vulnerable to American pressure.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The White House, which announced a formal review of its relationship with the Saudis, has not provided any details of the “consequences” it promised to impose on the House of Saud, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">What’s more, the wisdom of any secret deal with the Saudis may have been suspect all along, particularly considering the political risk the Biden administration ran by cozying up to a perpetually unpopular regime that it had previously vowed to shun. Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC+, but it cannot unilaterally dictate production quotas that would hurt the bottom line of most other members without risking its standing, its finances and the cohesion of the cartel, said Lippman.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And airing out dirty laundry publicly can only damage the scope of cooperation in the U.S.-Saudi relationship that may be sorely needed as the war in Ukraine unfolds, according to Karen E. Young, a political economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The broader concern that the Saudi government has is about market manipulation and other governments politicizing what Saudi Arabia can or can't do in the oil markets, as we have seen here,” said Young. “Whatever happens with Russia after the rollout of a European oil price cap and oil embargo is out of Saudi Arabia's control, and they fear they're going to take the blame for high energy prices regardless.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOr6Cer6NivKd50pqsnaFdlr%2BirsiaZKKmXZa6pr7InJhmp6CasG67yKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
