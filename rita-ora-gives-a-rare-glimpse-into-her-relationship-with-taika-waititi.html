During their brief stay in Düsseldorf, Germany, the couple spent their time trying out the food in the area, like they always do whenever they visit other cities.</p><p>“No matter where you are in the world, the one thing specific to the area, that you can’t really take with you is the food.” Waititi said. “So I like to try all the foods from that area.”</p><p>Ora agreed with her with the Thor: Love and Thunder director showing that they have the same likes and tastes. Afterward, they sneaked away for a visit to Golden Kettle Brewery, the city’s oldest brewery, where they explored their love languages.</p><p>“I like to reinforce&nbsp;the act of love in many different ways, and to me, gifts are something you can keep forever.” Ora said. “If they have a meaning, a personal touch, I&nbsp;basically gift people how I want to be gifted.”</p><p>Waititi agreed, and revealed that they attended an MTV EMA prep that included a&nbsp;fitting for Ora for her several outfit changes during the award show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rita Ora Slams the Constant Attention on Her Love Life</h2><p>The British singer recently opened up about her dislike of the public’s constant attention on her love life. Ora expressed that focusing on herself and her life’s work and career are her main goals and that relationships are a positive addition.</p><p>“I love love, I love being in love, it’s amazing and so fun,” Ora said. “Who doesn’t? I live life to the fullest. I’m an extremely passionate person when it comes to love, but I don’t base my life on relationships.”</p><p>She also criticizes that people don’t care if men ever had a hundred boyfriends or girlfriends. Ora has gained notoriety for relationships with some surprising celebrities, such as Travis Barker, Andrew Garfield, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Rob Kardashian</a>, and musician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Arthur</a>.</p><p>Ora feels that she’s “happy,” right now, having tied the knot with Waititi&nbsp;in an intimate ceremony in London.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jennifer-Hudson-Common-220x147.jpg alt="Jennifer Hudson, Common Continue to Spark Romance Rumors" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570aKrmmWfp65us8ivnKxlkWK%2For7EZp6loZ2lwKZ5yKerqGWYmr9uvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZq6irJhiwaK1yppksJmZqba1tY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
