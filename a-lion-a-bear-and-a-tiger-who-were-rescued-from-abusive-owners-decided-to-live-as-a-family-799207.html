But sometimes life makes for odd couplings (or&nbsp;triple-ings). A&nbsp;trio of&nbsp;these animals decided to&nbsp;form their own little weird pack and they live together in&nbsp;harmony, despite belonging to&nbsp;different species. From the trauma they faced together when they were young, these guys generated a&nbsp;unique bond. One that we&nbsp;can all learn from. This special BLT (bear, lion, tiger), as&nbsp;the group is&nbsp;known, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection of&nbsp;how all animals can grow to&nbsp;love each other, despite coming from different worlds.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you the story of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most unique and close-knit families of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="Animal Kingdom" data-link=tag>Animal Kingdom</a>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;sad discovery</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0dd/ec5/ac1477536991d833159c435ed1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2001, the Georgia State Police broke into a&nbsp;home and stumbled upon a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>heartbreaking scene</a>. In&nbsp;the basement of&nbsp;the house lay 3&nbsp;terrified cubs. A&nbsp;bear cub, a&nbsp;tiger cub, and a&nbsp;lion cub were all malnourished, infested with parasites, and showed signs of&nbsp;inhumane treatment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec4/551/aa1205518c9cc79c5d3ce5cff5.jpg><p>A&nbsp;black bear, Baloo, was trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;harness that had cut through his skin. A&nbsp;Bengal tiger, Shere Khan, looked near death, and Leo, an&nbsp;African lion, had been locked into a&nbsp;small box, despite having an&nbsp;open wound on&nbsp;his face. But those tragic days have come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new home for BLT</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e5/9ba/97af805c16b8bf7c480f618bd4.jpg><p>Authorities contacted the Georgia Department of&nbsp;Natural Resources and helped the trio move into their new home: a&nbsp;rescue center known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Noah’s Ark</a>. Baloo, Shere Khan, and Leo, still fearful from the trauma they’d been through, looked to&nbsp;each other for comfort. After a&nbsp;few months of&nbsp;healing, the cubs began to&nbsp;show more confidence in&nbsp;each other and themselves: They could be&nbsp;seen <a href=# title=grooming data-link=tag>grooming</a>, cuddling, and playing with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ab/cfa/edefdd51ddb09600035b62c4f2.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the trio became older, the rescue center leaders sadly anticipated that they might have to&nbsp;separate them as&nbsp;they grew into adulthood. They thought this made all the sense in&nbsp;the world, assuming the 3&nbsp;acted according to&nbsp;the laws of&nbsp;nature. But this family was too closely knit to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;any of&nbsp;these laws. They were brothers, and there was no&nbsp;way, or&nbsp;need as&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, to&nbsp;cut their fraternal bonds.</p><p><h2>Who Baloo, Shere Khan, and Leo grew into</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b1/455/0ee7045228aaf9afd2a595c119.jpg><p><a href=#>Baloo</a>, the American black bear, had suffered the most abuse as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cub and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;operated on&nbsp;when he&nbsp;was rescued. He&nbsp;was separated from his friends, and when he&nbsp;came back, they welcomed him with licks and all kinds of&nbsp;roughhousing, a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;animal affection. Baloo grew into a&nbsp;relaxed and confident bear who today would do&nbsp;absolutely anything for something sweet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e25/4dd/bd94cc58478c43b8f5f9749e6d.jpg><p><a href=#>Shere Khan</a>, the Bengal tiger, was the smallest of&nbsp;the 3&nbsp;and also the most mischievous. He&nbsp;attacked Baloo and Leo during playdates but, at&nbsp;the same time, could also be&nbsp;the most loving toward the others. Shere showed his love by&nbsp;headbutting his brothers and snuggling with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32a/6b1/10642f5dbf8dc858067d8690c7.jpg><p><a href=#>Leo</a>, the African lion, enjoyed long naps on&nbsp;the porch of&nbsp;his clubhouse. He&nbsp;obviously was fond of&nbsp;rest and also greatly enjoyed his moments of&nbsp;exploration, investigating new spaces, foods, smells, and toys which his caregivers offered him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f32/252/6a00cf5ead85277f0b2e5d5659.jpg><p><h2>The last good-bye</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8db/7e4/93de285342b4b33def8353c246.jpg><p>The 3&nbsp;brothers lived together for 15&nbsp;years. Their caretakers swear that they never saw them fight or&nbsp;get violent with each other, not even once. After surviving such a&nbsp;horrific nightmare together, they rewarded each other with many, many happy days.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, Leo was diagnosed with <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a> and <a href=#>left his siblings</a> shortly thereafter. Shere Khan <a href=#>followed him</a> in&nbsp;2018 and was buried next to&nbsp;his brother near their clubhouse, one of&nbsp;his favorite spots. Baloo is&nbsp;the only member of&nbsp;this trio left in&nbsp;the sanctuary and is&nbsp;waiting until the day the 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them get back together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c2/d07/7edc0853db86efde2bc5bb476a.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you think all animals are capable of&nbsp;overcoming their natural instincts like Baloo, Shere Khan, and Leo did?
