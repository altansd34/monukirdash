While the social networks are on nearly equal footing when it comes to elite sentiment online — roughly 4&nbsp;in 10 elite social media users say they have heard positive buzz online about Facebook and Snapchat, respectively — overall sentiment is in Facebook’s favor. Over the past week, a quarter of social media users say sentiment around Snapchat has been positive, while nearly 40 percent&nbsp;of users say the same about Facebook.</span></p><p><span>Snapchat’s problem may not be Facebook usurping its most-loved features, but could instead be its lack of awareness beyond millennials.</span></p><p><a href=#><span>A Morning Consult poll in March</span></a><span> showed tepid enthusiasm for Snapchat parent company Snap’s public offering.&nbsp;</span><span>Among adults with at least $50,000 in total investments as of February 2016, 64 percent said they do not have a Snapchat account, which may point to why nearly the same number of investors (63 percent) said they did not plan on investing when Snap became public.</span></p><p>Representatives for Facebook and Snap Inc. were not immediately available for comment.</p><p><strong>Correction</strong><strong>:</strong> A previous version of this story misstated Snapchat’s favorability among millennials.</p><p>Morning Consult’s <a href=#>Best Loved Brands Spring 2017</a>&nbsp;uses nearly&nbsp;200,000 interviews with American adults to provide an in-depth view of the companies, organizations and brands that define American culture and commerce. Net favorable scores subtract the percentage of people who give a company an unfavorable rating from the percentage that gave a favorable rating. This gives a snapshot of how well liked a company is, without penalizing companies for being not as well known.
