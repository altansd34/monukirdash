They are also common in many smaller towns and communities in the country. It is a much-loved tradition in Germany to meet friends at the flea market on a fine day and go shopping. Be it for some vintage clothes, antique furniture, hand-made jewelry, pre-loved books or to enjoy some locally made snacks, these markets are the place to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone loves a bargain (ein Schnäppchen) and Germans are particularly known for thrift, but these markets are also an environmentally friendly way to shop. It is an opportunity to give another lease on life to goods that might otherwise end up in attics or landfills.</p><p>So if you want to visit a German flea market and explore the treasure trove of artistic, unique and maybe antique items you will find there, we have a handy guide to the best flea markets in&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany’s largest cities</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-are-flea-markets-organized?->How are flea markets organized?&nbsp;</h2><p>Flea markets usually consist of rows of small wooden stalls, open or roofed, where sellers present their wares . Sellers pay a relatively small fee to rent a stall, and roofed stalls are generally more expensive than open ones.</p><p>Flea markets are different from jumble sales or car boot sales (der Trödelmarkt) in that each stall usually offers a distinctive type of product. All types of goods might be jumbled together at the car boot sale. To preserve the traditional character of the flea market, many organizers allow only pre-owned goods to be sold. Except for craftspeople and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">food sellers</a>, commercial traders are not permitted.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have spent much time in Germany at all, you will be familiar with the “shop closing law” (das Ladenschlussgesetz). While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shops and supermarkets</a> must stay closed on Sundays, flea markets run on this day.&nbsp; Be sure to check online though, as German flea market opening days may vary: Wednesdays and Saturdays are also popular.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Flea-market-culture-and-community-in-Germany>Flea market culture and community in Germany</h2><p>Although Germany doesn’t have quite as lively a culture of haggling (feilschen) as you might expect in markets in Eastern Europe or Turkey, prices are definitely up for negotiation. You will often find that traders are prepared to lower the price so you can drive a hard bargain and save yourself a tidy sum in the process.</p><p>Flea markets for baby and children’s goods are really popular in Germany. Kindergartens, youth clubs or church groups often organize these markets to sell the necessities for babies and children. Because the needs of children change so quickly as they grow, flea markets are used by many families to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cut down on expenses</a>. Others take advantage of them to declutter and bring in some extra&nbsp; finances for items no longer used at home.</p><p>Beyond the practicalities of your local flea market, a visit there can also present a great opportunity to meet locals and neighbors. They are important pillars of the local community and much of the charm of small-town markets comes from this spirit of neighborly cordiality .</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Best-flea-markets-in-Berlin>Best flea markets in Berlin</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Antique and Book Market at the Bode Museum&nbsp;</h3><p>In a picturesque location beside Museum Island, the Bode Museum Antique and Book Market is an excellent place for visitors with an interest in literature or history to collect some German books, antique postcards or Cold War trinkets.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Flea Market on Boxhagener Platz</h3><p>In the heart of Friedrichshain you will find the Boxhagener Platz Flohmarkt.
