YouGov’s latest white paper <a href=#>“Is there still hope for the high street?”</a> delves into some of the data and trends behind the downturn.</p><p>However, at the same time as some retailers – particularly department stores – are in turmoil, others are bucking the trend. Not only are some brands increasing profits, but they are also growing their customer base and even opening new stores.</p><p>What can the data tell us about some of these brands’ continued success against the odds?</p><p><strong>Primark</strong></p><p>Primark is one of few high street brands making a profit. Earlier this month it announced total sales had risen by 1% following a successful Christmas trading period. And while other retailers are closing stores, Primark intends to open more in 2019 including its largest ever in Birmingham.</p><p>But what is drawing customers to the budget brand? One factor could be the consistent value for money if offers. Primark’s BrandIndex value score (measuring whether a brand offers good or poor value for money) has risen by 11 points (from +15 to +26) since 2014.</p><p><strong>Next</strong></p><p>Despite a fall in profits, Next is doing well in terms of sales (particularly online) and its BrandIndex value for money score increased from +12 t0 +14 over the past four years. Its recommend and purchase intent scores have also risen over the same period (both by three points).</p><p>This growth is mainly driven by Gen X: a group more likely to have young children and to say their main motivations when choosing where to shop are cheap prices and good quality products.</p><p>Next’s partnership with Emma Willis also looks to be a savvy decision. According to <a href=#>YouGov Ratings data</a>, more than half of Gen Xers have a positive opinion of the TV presenter.</p><p><strong>River Island</strong></p><p>Like Next, River Island has been a fixture of the British high street for decades. However, it has revived its appeal among younger shoppers with progressive anti-stereotyping campaigns such as “Labels are for clothes”.</p><p>At a time when young shoppers have more choice than ever in terms of fashion brands, River Island’s value score rose by four points over the past year among 18-34 year olds.</p><p><strong>Superdrug</strong></p><p>Superdrug’s 2018 partnership with ITV’s Love Island was a hit with young people leading to a growth in profits as well as increased <a href=#>“brand warmth”</a>.</p><p>The data also shows that among 18-34 year olds, Superdrug is one of the most improved retailers in terms of perception of quality, with a rise of three points since 2018.</p><p>For more in-depth analysis on the state of the high street download the full white paper <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwbC8yJyqaJufo8C2ucSrZpqqpJ6wrbHSZqmeqJ%2BnwbR7kWlocmdgZ3xxfY6hprBlo6q%2Ft7XVnmShoZederTA0Z6crQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
