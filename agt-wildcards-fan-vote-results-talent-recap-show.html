Youtube Reading Time: 3 minutes This week on AGT the Judge Cuts ended and next week begin the live shows. The final acts were chosen to go through and the last Golden Buzzer was pressed. So, we asked you guys who you would want to come back as the AGT wildcard act. We also discussed why so many of the Golden Buzzers are kids."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So far the overwhelming majority of you want to see Izzy and Easton return. They were the two kids that did some amazing dance routines that told very clear stories. You know how hard it is to do that using just dance? Personally, I’d love to see them comeback as I don’t think they were given enough screen time for the caliber of talent they have. The others you guys liked were Matthew Richardson, the aerialist that works with the hoop. He’s also very good and I was initially surprised they cut him so early.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Izzy and Easton ‘AGT’ audition</figure><p>The act that’s really gaining on Izzy and Easton is Ansley Burns. We all remember Ansley. She’s the young girl who Simon told to start over and sing acapella twice and who had a tearful exit from the show. Some people in our comments said that she was given a second chance twice and needs to go and get some seasoning before she comes back. Others think she was wrongly cut. She’s cute and definitely has talent…but I’m in the maybe she should come back in the future camp.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why are so many Golden Buzzers kids?</h3><p>The other conversation we had, (after guest judge Jay Leno picked Emanne Beasha as his Golden Buzzer), is why so many of the Golden Buzzers were kids? Of the nine Golden Buzzers this year, six are children or teens. Luke Islam, Sophie Pecora, Emma Beasha, Tyler Butler-Figueroa, Light Balance Kids, and the Detroit Youth Choir are the kid Golden Buzzers. Also, V. Unbeatable from India also has a lot of children.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>I think it’s a pretty easy answer: kids are popular with fans. If you look at the Golden Buzzers over time you will notice that the more they have children get picked the better the show does. It started in earnest the year Grace VanderWaal won and continued the following season with Darci Lynne and Angelica Hale. Each year that they follow this strategy, the better the ratings are for AGT. So, it’s easy to see why the judges are always on the lookout for talented children.</p><p>This subject also brings up the point a lot of fans make that there should perhaps be an AGT: Kids. In other countries The Voice has a separate kids show and it seems to work well. Mel and I both think that we like the fact that there are acts of all age ranges. It is a VARIETY show, after all. It’s good to have…you know…variety.</p><p>What do you think?
