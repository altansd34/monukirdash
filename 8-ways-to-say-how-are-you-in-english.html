This is a question English speakers ask all the time. When we meet someone new, bump into a colleague at work and especially when we<strong> <a href=#>meet friends</a></strong>. It can get a bit repetitive to always ask the same question, we are here to help: You can ask “How are you” in English in a formal way, informally or even in slang. Here are a few ways to use different variations.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>General ways to ask “How are you?”&nbsp;in English</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How are you?</h3><p>We can’t leave this one out. It’s one of the most basic phrases in the <a href=#>Englis</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">h</a><a href=#> language</a> and you can use it in any context. With friends, colleagues, your boss, your teacher… it’s always good. The usual response, certainly in the English-speaking world is “Fine, thanks”, or “Good, thanks”. We would answer in this way even if the sky is falling around us. So a formal “How are you?” isn’t always a question that invites a truthful answer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How’s it going?</h3><p>“How’s it going?”&nbsp;is a bit more informal than&nbsp;“How are you?”. But, it’s still a very good general phrase you can use with most people. In&nbsp;<strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a></span></strong> speaking countries, it would be fine to use this phrase with someone more senior than you (like your boss), provided you have a bit of a relationship with them. But, again, the answer is likely to be, “Good, thanks”, even if it’s not true.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How’s everything?/How are things?</h3><p>This is a question you would ask someone you know. It implies that you know a bit about their life and that you don’t mind hearing about it. So you could ask a colleague, “How’s everything?”, and they might answer, “All good, thanks. That project I was working on…”.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What’s been going on?</h3><p>This is another good question to ask someone you know. It invites them to tell you a bit about their life and what has happened since you last saw them. So you’re more likely to hear a truthful answer to this question than you are if you ask ‘How are you?’.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Formal ways to say&nbsp;“How are you?” in English</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Are you well?</h3><p>People who ask this question expect you to simply say, “Yes, I’m very well, thanks”, or something similar. “Are you well?” doesn’t really invite a long, in-depth answer unless it’s being asked by someone close to you who happens to be quite old fashioned.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How are you keeping?</h3><p>“How are you keeping?” is old-fashioned and definitely more&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British than American</a></strong>. You can answer, “I’m keeping well” but this is really,&nbsp;really&nbsp;old fashioned, so it’s better to just say “Very well, thank you” or something similar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ways to say&nbsp;“How are you?”&nbsp;with friends</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What’s up?</h3><p>This is an informal way or slang to ask a friend, “How are you?”. Asking a friend or close colleague, “What’s up?” could give you a long or a short response. It could go: “What’s up?” – “Nothing much, you?”. Or, “What’s up?” – “I’ve got so much work to do…”. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English-speakers</a> also ask “What’s up?” when someone looks sad but in this case, of course, the tone of voice would be different.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What’s new?</h3><p>An informal way of asking, “What’s been going on”, this invites the person you are speaking to tell you a bit about themselves and their life.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>All right?</h3><p>“All right?” is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">informal way</a> to ask someone you know well how they are. You can give a short or a long answer to this question – it’s fine to say, “All right?”, “Yeah, all right?”, or to give a much longer answer about yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you have a lot of choices of ways to ask someone, “How are you?”. It’s good to remember which ones invite a longer answer so you can avoid asking them when you’re in a hurry!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
