Her husband realized that he was gay years ago.
Two weeks ago, Sarah’s husband of 15 years told her he’s gay. It was a revelation that hit her like a ton of bricks. They had built a life together, had three wonderful kids, and she always thought they were happy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;revelation that hit her like a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;bricks. They had built a&nbsp;life together, had <strong>three wonderful kids</strong>, and she always thought they were happy. His confession came out of&nbsp;nowhere, leaving her feeling like the ground had been pulled out from under her.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, Sarah didn’t know how to&nbsp;react. Her mind was a&nbsp;whirlwind of&nbsp;<a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a>—confusion, sadness, and a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;betrayal. Her husband explained that he&nbsp;had struggled for years and finally came to&nbsp;terms with the fact that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;gay. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;cannot continue to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;lie. Despite everything, he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;continue living together, but they can’t have intimacy anymore. He&nbsp;assures he&nbsp;still loves her, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way.</p><p><h2>Sarah feels lost but doesn't want to lose him either.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/724/436/fb30bc56fdaa227e469aa6b95b.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, Sarah didn’t know how to&nbsp;react. Her mind was a&nbsp;whirlwind of&nbsp;emotions—confusion, sadness, and a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;betrayal. Sarah could see the pain in&nbsp;his eyes and hear the sincerity in&nbsp;his voice when he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;loves her. They had shared so&nbsp;many moments, built so&nbsp;many memories, and he&nbsp;had been her best friend through it&nbsp;all. He&nbsp;had been a&nbsp;wonderful husband and an&nbsp;incredible father.</p><p>But knowing that their physical relationship is&nbsp;over and that there’s a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;him she never knew is&nbsp;heartbreaking. <strong>It&nbsp;felt like she had lost something profound, even though he&nbsp;was still there</strong>.</p><p><h2>They started seeing a therapist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/688/a51/1e6a1a5ef0b17eb7d7ca70265b.png><p>Their kids are young, and they haven’t told them yet. Sarah worries about how this will affect them and how they’ll explain such a complex situation. They both want to maintain a stable, <a href=# title=loving data-link=tag>loving</a> home for them, but the uncertainty of their future looms over them. She’s scared about what this means for their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> dynamic. They’ve always been a strong unit, and she doesn’t want this to break them.</p><p>Sarah is trying to come to terms with this new reality. <strong>They’ve started seeing a therapist to help navigate their emotions</strong> and figure out the best path forward. It’s not easy, and some days are harder than others. She still loves him too, and part of her wants to hold on to what they have, but another part of her feels lost and unsure. They’ve talked about remaining partners in raising their children and continuing to live together, but she worries about the long-term implications.</p><p><h2>Sarah still hopes that everything will be like before.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d54/2a1/05005950c2bdf4ab76a854f009.jpg><p>Your husband wants to live his life and wants you to hold it together for him. Time to let go.</p><p>Despite the turmoil, there are moments that remind Sarah of the bond they share. Like when he makes her coffee just the way she likes it, or when they both laugh at the silly things their kids do. These moments give her hope that they can find a way to navigate this new terrain without losing the essence of what makes their relationship special. But she also knows that it won’t be easy, and they’ll have to redefine what it means to be a family and a couple.</p><p><strong>Sarah is sharing this because she needs support and maybe some advice from anyone </strong>who has been through something similar. How do you cope with such a major shift in your relationship? How do you keep your family intact while dealing with your own pain and confusion?</p><p>All family <a href=#>secrets</a>, sooner or later, come to light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6tK3InWShnV2ewG6zwLJkm62kYrWmecuorZ6rXaKybq3NnWSsrZecsrTAxJ1krKedmsGptc2gZLCdmaexboSQcm1sbF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
