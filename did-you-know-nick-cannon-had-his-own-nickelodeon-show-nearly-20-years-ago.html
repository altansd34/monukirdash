It’s actually not the first time Cannon hosted his own show on a major network. Unlock a childhood memory as we look back on The Nick Cannon Show. It aired on Nickelodeon for only two seasons.</strong></p><p>Cannon rose to fame on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy hit All That. He became such a popular cast member on the show that the network decided to give him his own spinoff. The Nick Cannon Show aired from 2002 to 2003 for 27 episodes. Cannon would throw himself into the most random situations and try to add humor to them. Whether it was dancing, playing baseball, or going to the zoo, Cannon challenged himself with so many different and fun scenarios.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-must-see-clip-of-the-nick-cannon-show-will-bring-you-so-much-nostalgia>Must-See Clip of ‘The Nick Cannon Show’ Will Bring You So Much Nostalgia</h2><p>Cannon appeared in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a memorable sketch</a> with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney Spears</a>. He ripped his clothes off to reveal a full leather outfit before Spears taught him some iconic dance moves. Cannon shimmied for the camera, proof that even back then he had the same vibrant personality. Cannon mentioned this “incriminating” clip on his current talk show in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a segment</a> about Spears’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conservatorship</a>. He said that his leotard was so tight, viewers could see his “kibbles and bits.”</p><p>Cannon shared that the only reason the throwback clip was not aired on Nick Cannon this year is that the show’s lawyers could not clear it. Is that the truth or is he just embarrassed? Appearing on Nickelodeon led him to host Wild ‘N Out on MTV, now in its 16th season. He currently hosts The Masked Singer but it’s certainly fun to remember where his career started.</p><p>You absolutely need to watch this hilarious clip from The Nick Cannon Show. A younger, tinier Cannon boasted that he had what it took to take anyone down in the wrestling ring. He talked so much smack about his opponent, Ms. Joanie, and how he was going to give her noogies. WWE fans definitely will recognize Ms. Joanie who wrestled under the name Chyna. She was standing there the whole time listening to Cannon talk a big game. She playfully slapped him and he looked terrified.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Cannon zoomed around the ring in a unitard and a cape before getting his butt kicked. He tried to bite Joanie’s hair which only made her even angrier. She pinned him and told him never to mess with her ever again. In the end, she flung around a doll dressed like Cannon. Clips from The Nick Cannon Show are scarce on the internet but the ones that are available are seriously giggle-inducing.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ariana-scaled-1.jpeg alt="You be the Judge: Is Ariana Grande a Good Fit for ‘The Voice’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6KbZrGfqnqsus6wZKehk6B6pK3Np6anZZiWsW60yKxkqK%2BeYruqr8qeo6iclaS7br%2FHqK5mppWWv63FjGtnZrGVlr%2B0ecCgpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
