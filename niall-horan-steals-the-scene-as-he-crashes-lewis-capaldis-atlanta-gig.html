During his show in Atlanta, Georgia, the singer was joined by close friend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Horan</a>, who happened to have happily crashed his concert.</p><p>Wearing an all-white outfit, the “Before You Go” singer enthusiastically welcomed Horan to come on stage, following the crowd’s roar. This moment was then beautifully captured, with Capaldi sharing the same to his Instagram.</p><p>“It’s time to BeReal,” he wrote.</p><p>The video footage shows Capaldi running towards Horan who was wearing a pair of jeans and green jacket. The former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> member was then posing a thumbs up so Capaldi could snap a photo for his BeReal. As they embraced in a tight hug, both are evidently happy to have seen each other.</p><p>The “This Town” singer then quickly made his exit, allowing his friend to continue the gig. According to Capaldi’s on-screen caption in the video, that moment was “Niall Horan stealing the spotlight at your show.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-thrilled-to-see-their-adorable-interaction>Fans are Thrilled to See Their Adorable Interaction</h2><p>Upon watching the video upload, both Capaldi and Horan’s fans have expressed their excitement about the duo. One fan even jokingly claimed that Capaldi is the “6th member of 1D.”</p><p>“best duo to walk this earth,” one fan wrote.</p><p>Some have been asking for a collaboration from the two, while others are simply pleased by their cute interaction on stage. Apparently though, some One Direction fans theorized that Capaldi might be the “glue” to bond the boy band again.</p><p>At present, most of Capaldi’s remaining tour dates are already sold-out. Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent tour is expected to end in October 17, at Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/American-Idol-Showstoppers1-220x146.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Judges Choose the Top 24 in Showstoppers Round" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKYpaRdnbyzrc1mqq2dkaHAbsDHnmSsm5Wjsm6t0mafnmWTp660tMSsZKWdp57Abq%2FAqZilnJmoeqLAy5qlrZldnLaoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
