Ray is competing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chance the Rapper’s</a> team, winning his way through the Battles and Knockouts.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-artist-ray-uriel-started-as-a-theater-kid>The Voice Artist Ray Uriel Started as a Theater Kid</h2><p>Ray is originally from Gary, Indiana, although he has since moved to Arizona. The 25-year-old became interested in music at a young age and even attended a performing arts school. As he shared in his audition, he started out performing in choirs and doing musical theater, including a production of Les Misérables.</p><p>“I’m honored to be representing all of Indiana, especially Gary in this competition,” Ray told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local news</a>. “This is for all of the people back home who have inspired me over the years. I wouldn’t be here without the community that inspired and taught me all that I know about music and life.”</p><p>In 2020, Ray reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">graduated</a> with honors from the University of Indianapolis, where he studied music and theater. According to Ray’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Voice bio</a>, he currently works as a business and data analyst, but he spends his free time pursuing a career in music. He shared in his audition that he enjoys writing original songs, and he’s even released a few singles, including 2018’s “Escaped (We Don’t)” and his most recent title “Without Me.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IS ‘THE VOICE’ RETURNING THIS FALL?

It seemed like he might not turn any of the coaches’ chairs, but then at the very last second, Chance the Rapper hit his button to turn around. Ray automatically joined his team.</p><p>“You just remind me of a recording artist,” Chance told Ray after his performance. “You feel to me like a person that makes songs and has, you know, certain intricacies to your voice … I was like, ‘This dude has potential to kill any song.’ And I’m excited to work with you.”</p><p>Ray went on to compete in the Battles <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">against NOIVAS</a> on a cover of “Jealous Guy” by John Lennon. Chance chose Ray as the winner, and he moved on to the Knockouts. He performed “Lately” by Stevie Wonder and ended up beating NariYella to keep his spot on Chance’s team.</p><p>While you’re waiting to see Ray’s next performance on The Voice Season 23, you can follow his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram account</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_TeamBlakeTop12_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Teams Blake, Chance Shine on Stage, Secure Semifinal Singers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWilsZuwdGinKVlpJqurnnCoZinm5WoerS71KWdrqRdpLumecKhmKKqXanCs7qMqKVmrJiaere7yJycaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
