Others are showing their kids only from the back or&nbsp;not showing them at&nbsp;all.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> checked out the reasons why more and more parents are starting to&nbsp;think about their kids’ privacy on&nbsp;social media, and here they are.</p><p><h2>It’s about kids making their own decisions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bf/a61/ac3faf529ba1ed7fb2c1c136d2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her note addressed to&nbsp;paparazzi, the press, and fan accounts, Gigi Hadid said she didn’t want her little daughter Khai’s face being shown in&nbsp;photographs. The model said she tries her best to&nbsp;protect her child by&nbsp;not showing her face, but some pictures showing her baby daughter can still be&nbsp;snapped. Gigi asked people using these photographs to&nbsp;blur Khai’s face, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>explained</a> why it’s so&nbsp;important: it’s up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her daughter to&nbsp;decide what things about herself she wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>“You know we&nbsp;have never intentionally shared our daughter’s face on&nbsp;social media. Our wish is&nbsp;that she can choose how to&nbsp;share herself with the world when she comes of&nbsp;age, and that she can live as&nbsp;normal of&nbsp;a&nbsp;childhood as&nbsp;possible, <strong>without worrying about a&nbsp;public image that she has not chosen</strong>,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>said</a> Gigi.</p><p>There are other celebrity parents who choose to&nbsp;hide their kids’ faces from the public, and <a href=# title="Kristen Bell" data-link=tag>Kristen Bell</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. She often uses emojis to&nbsp;cover her kids’ faces in&nbsp;the photos she shares on&nbsp;social media, and she does it&nbsp;for the same reason&nbsp;— she wants her children to&nbsp;make their own choice.</p><p>“My&nbsp;feeling is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I chose a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;the public eye. I&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quoted, I&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;picture taken. I&nbsp;don’t know them yet. <strong>I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;they will want that.</strong> So&nbsp;I&nbsp;really don’t have the right to&nbsp;choose for them,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>says</a> Kristen.</p><p><h2>It’s about their privacy.</h2></p><p>Children’s rights advocates have been urging parents to&nbsp;think twice before sharing information about their kids, including their pictures, because there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>conflict</a> between the kids’ right to&nbsp;privacy and their parents’ right to&nbsp;post. Experts believe it’s important to&nbsp;ask your child whether they want their pictures to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shared with the world or&nbsp;not. These conversations will <strong>give kids the necessary feeling of&nbsp;autonomy</strong>, respect, and parental support, and help them develop their private and public identities.</p><p><h2>It’s about their safety.</h2></p><p>Another reason why many moms and dads prefer to&nbsp;hide the faces of&nbsp;their children is&nbsp;because oversharing can also be&nbsp;dangerous. You never know who will look at&nbsp;your kids’ photos or&nbsp;how they’re going to&nbsp;use them. Unfortunately, there are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>people</a> on&nbsp;the internet who can potentially harm your child. The photos you share with good intentions to&nbsp;show the world how cute, beautiful, smart, or&nbsp;talented your child&nbsp;is, may be&nbsp;<strong>used and shared by&nbsp;others in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way you never even thought&nbsp;of</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed0/325/cd56c9527c998faf13683c1dce.jpg><p>Each parent has their own reason for sharing or&nbsp;not sharing their kids’ photos on&nbsp;social media. But whatever these reasons are, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;think about what kind of&nbsp;information we&nbsp;should not share with the world. Earlier we&nbsp;talked about the types of&nbsp;kids’ photographs that are better to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;shared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;public space in&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>article</a>, and we&nbsp;hope this safety guide can come in&nbsp;handy for moms and dads who like posting about their kids.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you share your kids’ photos on&nbsp;social media?
