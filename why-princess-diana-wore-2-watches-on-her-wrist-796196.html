For example, the Queen of&nbsp;Hearts <a href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;wear gloves while she was out on&nbsp;official duty, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;people and show them affection.

The camera caught her watching her fiancé playing polo at&nbsp;the Guards Polo Club in&nbsp;Windsor. Everything looked pretty ordinary, except for one small and pretty extravagant detail: Diana had 2&nbsp;watches on&nbsp;her wrist.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sign that she cared.</h2></p><p>As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turned out, the gold metallic watch with a&nbsp;thin strap was Diana’s but the darker one belonged to&nbsp;Charles. Diana <a href=#>shared</a> that she wore Charles’ watch as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;him and to&nbsp;bring him good luck.</p><p><h2>This gesture reminded&nbsp;us of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old tradition from the middle ages.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbb/caf/3b016652edaf158ea58352ca0a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the middle ages, there was a&nbsp;<a href=#>tradition</a> to&nbsp;tie a&nbsp;lady’s handkerchief to&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;a&nbsp;knight’s helmet before a&nbsp;joust. A&nbsp;handkerchief was perceived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;good luck charm and it&nbsp;was the way to&nbsp;show support to&nbsp;the person entering the competition.</p><p>Unfortunately, Diana’s and Charles’ <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> wasn’t meant to&nbsp;last, but this sweet gesture illustrates that they definitely had love and tenderness in&nbsp;their relationship, at&nbsp;least at&nbsp;its very beginning.</p><p><h2>This wasn’t the only time Diana showed her love with a&nbsp;sentimental gesture.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dbc/fcc/9b731e5150ad8f89bc7d50b8dd.jpg><p>Diana refused to&nbsp;wear the tiara that was loaned to&nbsp;her by&nbsp;the Queen on&nbsp;her wedding day. Instead, she chose the one that had been in&nbsp;her family for many years. With this gesture, Diana showed that she decided to&nbsp;stay true to&nbsp;her family’s traditions, because many women, including her sister, had gotten married in&nbsp;this tiara.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any special thing that reminds you of&nbsp;your loved ones?
