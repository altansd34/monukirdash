Bravo, that’s the right attitude to apply everything you’ve learned! But depending on our character, it is not always easy to approach a new person, especially in a language that is not our own. Here are some ice breakers to help you make the first move in French!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to start a conversation in French</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>“Briser la glace” in French</strong></h3><p>The French expression “briser la glace” comes from the English “ice breaker”. It refers to all the little phrases that allow a person to start a conversation with a stranger. It means that by approaching the other person, you will put an end to an awkward or tense situation (a situation where there was “ice” before).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Finding a common interest</strong> in French</h3><p>Whether you’re on a café terrace, at a friend’s party or in a waiting room, you’ve probably noticed someone you’d like to talk to. But how do you approach him or her without looking ridiculous? You have to find a common interest and ask questions. These days it’s not easy to talk to someone, even at a bus stop, because people are often absorbed in their phones. But you can try these phrases below depending on the situation you are in:</p><li>Excusez-moi le wifi fonctionne bien pour vous&nbsp;? Moi, je n’arrive pas à me connecter. – Excuse me, is the wifi working well for you? I can’t get online. (A phrase that works well in the library for example!)</li><li>Il y a beaucoup de monde aujourd’hui, ou c’est moi&nbsp;?&nbsp;– It’s very busy today, or is it just me? (in transport, in shops…)</li><li></li><li>J’adore cette chanson&nbsp;! C’est de qui&nbsp;?&nbsp;– I love this song! Who is it from? (At a party, or even in a shop!)</li><li>Excusez-moi, savez-vous où se trouve…&nbsp;? –&nbsp;(Pretend you are lost) Excuse me, do you know where is…?</li><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">6 essential grammar rules you need to know about French grammar</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ice breakers about the weather in French</strong></h3><p>This is THE subject that will be discussed with anyone, anytime!

But we forget that the person has probably heard them a thousand times before!</p><ul><li>Ton père est un voleur&nbsp;: il a pris toutes les étoiles du ciel pour les mettre dans tes yeux.&nbsp;– (the classic) Your father is a thief: he took all the stars in the sky and put them in your eyes.</li></ul><ul><li>On devrait t’arrêter pour excès de beauté sur la voie publique. – You should be arrested for excessive beauty on the public highway.</li></ul><ul><li>En temps normal, je suis un très bon nageur, mais là je ne comprends pas, je me noie dans tes yeux. – Normally I’m a very good swimmer, but I don’t understand, I’m drowning in your eyes.</li></ul><ul><li>J’ai un problème avec mon téléphone&nbsp;: il manque ton numéro. – I have a problem with my phone: your number is missing.</li></ul><p>If you’re a gambler, you can try these phrases in a humorous way!

She comes from the west of France, and after living 2 years in Spain and 4 years in Oxford in England, she has just settled in the heart of France, in Auvergne, a land of cheese, rugby, Michelin tires and ancient volcanoes. Audrey definitely prefers the first one. She speaks French, Spanish and English, and just started German, nothing better to understand her students who tremble at the French grammar! When she is not teaching, she tries to find time to cook or sing in a choir. She loves to invite people to her house to feed them and trap them with musical blind tests designed and adapted to her guests!
