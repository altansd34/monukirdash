In a new interview, Clarkson opened up about leaving the talent show and moving her talk show to New York City.</strong> <strong>The singer last appeared as a coach in Season 23.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-kelly-clarkson-isn-t-returning-to-the-voice>Why Kelly Clarkson Isn’t Returning to The Voice</h2><p>For the fifth season of her talk show, Clarkson relocated to from Los Angeles to New York City. The singer told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a> that she “needed a fresh start” after her divorce from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock. During recent seasons of The Voice, Clarkson said she “put on a smile a lot of those times because I was struggling a lot in my personal life.”</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot about what I’m capable of handling, and also what you should not handle. That was me saying ‘bye’ to The Voice and having this big move,” Clarkson said of her decision to leave the show. “I love that family, but I was like, ‘I’m struggling. I can’t smile anymore. I don’t feel like smiling.'”</p><p>Clarkson had previously taken a break from coaching in Season 22 before returning earlier this year. At the time, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson said</a> she wanted to take a summer off and “shut down for a minute.”</p><p>The American Idol winner shared that she’s “in such a great place” now, adding, “I feel like a weight has lifted. That move was very needed. I think the thing I’m most excited about with Season 5, on a selfish level, is just showing up to work smiling and actually meaning it. That’s a beautiful gift that you don’t realize until you’re out of it.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE’S WHY KELLY CLARKSON WON’T RELEASE ANY MORE TRACKS FROM ‘CHEMISTRY (DELUXE)’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clarkson-is-returning-to-las-vegas-this-year>Clarkson Is Returning to Las Vegas This Year</h2><p>Clarkson may not have any plans to return to The Voice, but she will be going back to Las Vegas to perform several new shows in the residency she started earlier this year.
