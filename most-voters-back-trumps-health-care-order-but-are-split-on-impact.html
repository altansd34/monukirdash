Fifty-two percent of voters said they support Trump’s plan to make it easier for small businesses to band together in associations to sponsor low-cost, less comprehensive health care coverage across state lines, while 30 percent said they oppose the policy, according to a new Morning Consult/Politico poll of 1,991 registered voters that was conducted online Oct."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thirty-nine percent of all respondents, and 64 percent of GOP voters, agreed with the Trump administration’s argument that allowing insurance plans to be sold across state lines would increase consumer options and competition, causing consumer costs to decrease.</p><p>On the other hand, 36 percent of all respondents – and 57 percent of Democrats – said healthier, younger consumers would flee the Obamacare markets for cheaper insurance, causing premiums to skyrocket for high-risk individuals on the exchanges.</p><p>Voters were more likely to say the executive order would have a negative effect on high-risk individuals. More than four in 10 voters (43 percent), a plurality, said the order would have a negative impact on sick individuals, while a fourth of respondents said it would have a positive impact.</p><p>Voters were more closely split on how healthy individuals would fare, with 34 percent saying they would benefit, 29 percent saying it wouldn’t affect them, and 20 percent saying they would be negatively impacted by the order.</p><p>One in four voters said they didn’t know or had no opinion how Trump’s order would affect health insurance costs – a possible sign that public sentiment could change as the federal rule-making process advances in the coming months, said Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank.</p><p>Despite initial public support for Trump’s order, a plurality of 46 percent of voters said they would be unlikely to swap their current health plan for one that is cheaper with less generous coverage, while 36 percent said they would switch.</p><p>“We know from virtually all the polls that have been conducted for the last 30 years that people who have health insurance” are fairly satisfied with the health care they have, Bowman said Tuesday.</p><p>But voters’ inclination to buy cheaper coverage may be clearer once details of a plan emerge.</p><p>“I imagine a lot of the interest over time may depend very much on how the rules are written,” said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at consulting company Avalere Health, on Monday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxyfI5qb2iln6jBbsLOrZyrq12XrqS3jK2prqWgqHqpscClq6Flk5a%2FpnnOq5ueql2XwrV5wKucZqugoba1ec6nZKKloJawtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
