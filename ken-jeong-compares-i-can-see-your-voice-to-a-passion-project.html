According to the host, the show is all about feeling good.</p><p>“At the very core, you’re trying to help a contestant win life-changing money,” he said. “It’s just one contestant, which is amazing. It’s a feel-good type of show, but the intricacies are, you have these six secret voices.”</p><p>Indeed, the show doesn’t have much intense and competitive aspect on the part of the contestant. They basically just have to be wise and mindful of their guessing strategy. Due to this, Jeong said &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Can See Your Voice</a> is more like an enthusiastic work for most of the cast.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“If there was like a game show that’s like a passion project, this would be that,” he said. “When the contestants are winning life-changing money. It’s that extreme makeover.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Jeong also talked about his medical knowledge and how he can use it for his entertainment career. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comedian</a>, he could serve as the cast’s “common sense advisor.”</p><p>“If we’re on a really crowded set and let’s say [it’s] really really hot. This has happened a lot of times,” he said. “You know, humid weather. Let’s say you’re filming in Atlanta or something. Sometimes, background actor without proper support. What if they almost pass out.”</p><p>Jeong earned a medical degree and was a practicing physician for several years. He, however, switched to a Hollywood career out of passion.</p><p>“I always just tell people, just use common sense. ‘Oh that person’s about to faint.’ You know, just certain things like that,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-joel-mchale-pokes-fun-at-jo-koy-during-emmys-night>He, Joel McHale Pokes Fun at Jo Koy During Emmys Night</h2><p>Recently, Jeong and Joel McHale seemingly dragged Jo Koy’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Globe</a> monologue at the 2023 Emmy Awards. Amid their presentation of Outstanding Reality-Competition Program award, the duo hilariously took a subtle jab at Koy.</p><p>For those who may not know, Koy defended his flat jokes on having just a 10-day preparation for the gig.</p><p>During their time on stage, McHale joked that Jeong left his medical profession because he killed a patient. He then stated that Jeong is still facing a legal case because of it.</p><p>“That’s not on the prompter! You can’t say that,” he said. “The instruments that almost killed that dude were the ones the nurses left in. The ones that saved his life, I left in. Besides, I only had the gig for 10 days at that point, so give me a break.”</p><p>During the Golden Globes, Koy struggled to draw laughs from the live audience.</p><p>“Some [jokes] I wrote, some other people wrote,” Koy joked during the show. “Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue? Shut up. You’re kidding me, right? I wrote some of these, and they’re the ones you’re laughing at.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_MadameLaQueer_Sarah-Morris_WireImage-220x147.jpg alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Season 4 Queen, Madame LaQueer Comes Out as Trans ‘It’s Never Too Late’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>i can see your voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ken jeong</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6lZqKVpLuoecKopKmZoprAbrWMnJinZaOasm7Fzq6pZq6fnrCmedOoZJploJbAtLXOp2Spqp%2BfsqTAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
