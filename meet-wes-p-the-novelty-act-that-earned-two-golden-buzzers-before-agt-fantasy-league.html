Known for stripping down and utilizing a strategically placed tablecloth in his comedy routines, he previously won Golden Buzzers on both Georgia’s Got Talent and France’s Got Talent for his viral act.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-man-behind-the-outrageous-comedy>The Man Behind the Outrageous Comedy</h2><p>Based in Saitama, Japan, Wes-P also goes by Mr. Uekusa. He has been performing his distinctive style of novelty entertainment since at least 2017. His tension-filled routines generally involve slowly stripping all his clothes off before utilizing cups, bottles, or other objects and a tiny tablecloth on his private parts to elicit shocked reactions.</p><p>Over the years, Wes-P has brought stripped-down versions of his tablecloth act to AGT and <a href=#>Britain</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘</a><a href=#>s Got Talent</a> along with the Czech, German, and Georgian versions. He managed to reach the Semi-Finals of BGT in 2018. That same year he won <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">France’s Got Talent</a>‘s Golden Buzzer and placed second runner-up overall, proving his viral appeal.</p><p>Part of what makes Wes-P’s act so shareable is its treading into taboo territory, relying partially on audiences wondering if he’ll accidentally expose himself. By keeping viewers guessing, he’s crafted a distinctive style of comedy focused solely on the reveal.</p><p>After nearly ten Got Talent franchise appearances and years of internet virality, Wes-P has honed his set down to an almost scientific method for eliciting gasps. His mastery of suspense-building also translates well across languages and cultures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-returning-to-agt-fantasy-league>Returning to AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>Though Wes-P was previously eliminated early on AGT, his selection as one of the viewer-voted Fantasy League acts gives him another shot to showcase his offbeat entertainment chops to American audiences. Fans can likely expect him to reprise a variation of his signature balancing tablecloth reveal using either teacups or champagne bottles.</p><p>Given his penchant for gradually upping the tension and danger, he may incorporate fire, swords, or another risky twist into his tried-and-true formula. His persona of overt focus and intensity throughout makes the reveal all the more shocking each time.</p><p>Interestingly, Wes-P stood out as the sole act on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a> who didn’t progress to the live shows. Despite this setback, fans will likely see Wes-P return on an upcoming Got Talent show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_MelB_Frazer-HarrisonGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Who Is Returning ‘AGT: Fantasy League’ Judge, Mel B?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWnmsBuvIytn55lnqTDprjTsmSam6Riwamt02acmqqemrFuwNaoZKCnnJmyr3nBrrGznaKoeqOxxaipnmWRnMFussCnq5qrqWK5pq3Grpxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
