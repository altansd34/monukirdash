And how would you feel if you were&nbsp;skint?&nbsp;When you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn English</a> and travel to the British Isles, you might feel a little confused when it comes to everyday interactions with locals. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British</a>&nbsp;have a lot of unique slang and at times it might slip into conversations. So, not to let it ambush you, let’s&nbsp;crack on&nbsp;and learn some.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Essential-British-slang-words>Essential British slang words</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Cuppa</h3><p>If you learn only one word before traveling to the UK, let it be&nbsp;cuppa. Meaning “a cup of tea”,&nbsp;you’ll barely get through the door of any British home before you hear, “Fancy&nbsp;a&nbsp;cuppa?”&nbsp;Just make sure you specify if you want it with milk or not – I know the great <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British</a> drink&nbsp;makes some foreigners a little queasy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Pint</h3><p>If you don’t fancy&nbsp;a cuppa, maybe you’d prefer&nbsp;a&nbsp;pint? Walking into a pub and saying, “I’ll have&nbsp;a&nbsp;pint&nbsp;please,” always means a pint of beer, don’t expect to get a pint of water or lemonade handed to you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=More-British-Slang-words>More British Slang words</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Budge Up</h3><p>This means “move over” or “make space for me to sit down”. Say this to someone you know well, not a stranger on the Tube.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Skint</h3><p>Of all the things you want to be, skint&nbsp;is definitely not one of them. This British slang term means you have no money.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Crack on</h3><p>Get on with it, keep going or start doing something. While working you might hear, “Let’s&nbsp;crack&nbsp;on, the pub closes in half an hour.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Quid</h3><p>One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Pound</a>. “Mate, lend me a&nbsp;quid&nbsp;for some chips, I’m&nbsp;skint.” (A&nbsp;quid&nbsp;actually won’t get you very far in the UK. You’d need at least a&nbsp;fiver&nbsp;(£5), or more likely a&nbsp;tenner&nbsp;(£10) to get a decent amount of food.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Chuffed</h3><p>Very happy. “I was really&nbsp;chuffed&nbsp;when I found a&nbsp;tenner&nbsp;in my pocket.”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Gutted</h3><p>The opposite of chuffed, so very disappointed or unhappy. “I was&nbsp;gutted&nbsp;when I heard Prince Harry had got married.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Knackered</h3><p>Really tired. “I’m&nbsp;knackered, I was binge-watching Netflix all night.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. Dying/Dead</h3><p>This has replaced ‘LOL’ – so it means you found something really, really funny. “Donald Trump’s hair.” “Dead.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>11. Gagging</h3><p>Originally used to mean retching – and it still means that – gagging is also used for when you’re really thirsty. “I’m&nbsp;gagging&nbsp;for&nbsp;a cuppa&nbsp;– tough day.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>12. Cheeky</h3><p>“I stopped for a&nbsp;cheeky&nbsp;curry on the way home.” I know it wasn’t healthy to eat that, that’s why I’m telling you it was&nbsp;cheeky. Also used with drinks: “I had a&nbsp;cheeky&nbsp;pint of cider to celebrate!” This can also mean you had more than one. “Let’s go for a&nbsp;cheeky&nbsp;wine after work”, can also suggest, let’s go to the pub until closing time.&nbsp;</p><p>Cheeky&nbsp;can also be used as low-level rude. “Ooh, he’s a bit&nbsp;cheeky” meaning he’s quite attractive.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>13. Cheers</h3><p>You probably know this one in the context of clinking glasses in a pub. But Brits also use&nbsp;cheers&nbsp;to say “thank you” or even to say “goodbye”. Not to be said in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American accent</a> – you guys across the pond really can’t pull it off. It’s like a Brit trying to say&nbsp;howdy y’all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=British-words-for-being-drunk>British words for being drunk</h2><p>It’s no secret that a lot of Brits like a few&nbsp;cheeky pints&nbsp;every now and again. So it follows that we have quite a few adjectives to describe a state of drunkenness.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>14. Trollied</h3><p>Not much to do with a supermarket trolley, I don’t think. Other than that, you might well see some tipsy British students pushing their mates home in a trolley they’ve “borrowed” from Tesco.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>15. Legless</h3><p>As in so drunk your legs aren’t working the way you want them to.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>16. Plastered</h3><p>Very drunk.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>17. Wasted</h3><p>As above. And there are so many more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Portmanteau-words>Portmanteau words</h2><p>Aka, smashing two words together to make a new one. An example that almost everyone the world over knows&nbsp;is brunch, a combination of “breakfast” and “lunch”. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>18. Ginormous</h3><p>Put gigantic and enormous in a room together and nine months later they will have a&nbsp;ginormous&nbsp;baby.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>19. Craptacular</h3><p>This one is a little rude – just a little, honestly; it is a portmanteau of “crap” and “spectacular”. It is usually used to talk about entertainment that is so bad it’s good. “Mamma Mia 2&nbsp;is&nbsp;craptacular&nbsp;– it’s my guilty pleasure watching when I’m on a plane.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>20. Brexit</h3><p>Maybe one not to mention at the moment in the UK as it’s a sore subject for both sides. But&nbsp;Brexit&nbsp;is an amalgamation of “Britain” and “exit”. “So, who voted for&nbsp;Brexit?”… cue awkward silence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Slang it up!</h2><p>What makes learning a language such a unique experience is getting out of the context of textbooks and immersing, instead, into the real language. The one people use on a daily basis might sound a little weird or unfamiliar at first. Start getting some practice on these 20 words from the British slang and get ready for that language win. You going to be chuffed!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years. She was born in the UK and has lived in Australia and Poland, where she writes blogs for Lingoda about everything from grammar to dating English speakers. She’s definitely better at the first one. She loves travelling and that’s the other major topic that she writes on. Laura likes pilates and cycling, but when she’s feeling lazy she can be found curled up watching Netflix. She’s currently learning Polish, and her battle with that mystifying language has given her huge empathy for anyone struggling to learn English.
