It may have originated from Gaelic or from Norman-French. What we do know, is that in Scotland, it means a good time surrounded by friends, ceilidh dancing and laughter.&nbsp;</li><li>Historically, Christmas was not observed as a festival in Scotland and Hogmanay was the more traditional celebration. Nowadays, Christmas is widely celebrated, with Hogmanay signalling that the festive period is coming to an end and a new year is beginning</li><li>4.'The Bells' is the phrase used to describe the midnight hour when New Year's Eve becomes New Year's Day. It stems from the noise the church bells make as the clock strikes midnight signalling the beginning of a new day and a new year.</li><li>Famous Scottish poet Robert Burns' 'Auld Lang Syne' is sung to celebrate the start of the New Year at the stroke of midnight, not just in Scotland but in many countries around the world.</li><li>The Guinness Book of World Records lists 'Auld Lang Syne' as one of the most frequently sung songs in English. The song is sung or played in many movies, from festive blockbuster 'It's a Wonderful Life' to romantic comedy 'When Harry Met Sally.</li><li>To sing 'Auld Lang Syne' a circle is created and hands are joined with the person on each side of you. At the beginning of the last verse, everyone crosses their arms across their breast, so that the right hand reaches out to the neighbour on the left and vice versa. When the tune ends, everyone rushes to the middle, while still holding hands.</li><li>An important element of Hogmanay celebrations is to welcome friends and strangers, with warm hospitality and of course a kiss to wish everyone a 'Guid New Year'. The underlying belief is to clear out the vestiges of the old year, have a clean break and welcome in a young, New Year on a happy note.</li><li>'First Footing' – the 'first foot' in the house after midnight is still very common is Scotland. To ensure good luck, a first footer should be a dark-haired male. Fair-haired first footers were not particularly welcome after the Viking invasions of ancient times. Traditional gifts include a lump of coal to lovingly place on the host's fire, along with shortbread, a black bun and whisky to toast to a Happy New Year.</li><li>To first foot a household empty-handed is considered grossly discourteous, never mind unlucky! You must not only bring yourself, but a gift of some description for the kind host. Consider yourself sufficiently warned!&nbsp;</li><p><a href=#>Read Visit Scotland's guide to Edinburgh's Hogmanay</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqKlrKiZp661tc6nZqGnl6Kur63YZquoqF2brqTA0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
