Two in five Conservative members (38%) want Truss to remain in post.
These are similar numbers to those Boris Johnson received from the membership on the eve of his departure, when 59% wanted him to go and only 36% wanted him to say."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One in three (32%) say he is the person they would most want to take over, followed by 23% for former chancellor and leadership rival Rishi Sunak and 10% for defence secretary Ben Wallace.</p><p>Those who voted for Truss to take over are particularly keen on a Boris Johnson return if she left: 44% put him top of their list of potential successors.</p><p>In terms of their capability to handle the role of prime minister, a majority of members think that four from a list of 11 potential successors would be good replacements: Boris Johnson (63%), Ben Wallace (62%), Rishi Sunak (60%) and leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt (54%).</p><h3>How should a Truss replacement be elected?</h3><p>Many Conservatives are concerned that having to hold another leadership election in the event that Liz Truss resigned would go down very poorly with the public.</p><p>This eventuality seems to be on the minds of party members as well, with 60% saying they would support MPs backing a single unity candidate without the need for an election in the event that Liz Truss stood down. One in three (37%) would oppose this.</p><p>Party members are split on whether it would be ok to replicate the previous format of leadership election, with 45% saying they would support MPs whittling a candidates list down to two for party members to vote on, and 50% opposed.</p><p>Less popular would be candidates getting around the rules to avoid an election proceeding to the party membership stage. In this scenario MPs would put forward two candidates, but the candidate that saw the lowest support in the final round of MP voting would drop out of the race, thereby making the other candidate the automatic winner under current rules. Half (52%) would oppose such manoeuvres, with 40% supportive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGl9eoSMpqasrF2pvLPFjKacppqVp8Buv8CyZKWhqmLBs8HSrGSsoJ%2BquaV50Z6qop%2Be</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
