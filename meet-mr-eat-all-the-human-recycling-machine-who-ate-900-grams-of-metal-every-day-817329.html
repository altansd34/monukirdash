Lotito ate metal, so&nbsp;much&nbsp;so, that he&nbsp;ingested an&nbsp;airplane, and multiple bikes, and his list doesn’t stop here&nbsp;— keep reading to&nbsp;find out the oddest items on&nbsp;his menu.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all began when Lotito was taking a&nbsp;sip of&nbsp;water.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/718/e62/24a7d15e29b0ddb11482060eed.jpg><p>Born in&nbsp;France, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mr. Lotito</a> started consuming strange stuff when he&nbsp;was 16&nbsp;years old&nbsp;— and it&nbsp;all began when a&nbsp;glass he&nbsp;was drinking from shattered glass, and he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;having a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;glass in&nbsp;his mouth. He&nbsp;was aware other people had eaten glass in&nbsp;the past, so&nbsp;at&nbsp;that moment, he&nbsp;decided he&nbsp;could too. This led to&nbsp;him becoming a&nbsp;performer, ultimately earning up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;a day.</p><p>Lotito suffered from an&nbsp;eating disorder called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pica</a>, where subjects have a&nbsp;big appetite for non-food substances, such as&nbsp;ice, dust, metal, wood, hair, paper, etc. He&nbsp;gained the nickname, Mr. Mange-Tout in&nbsp;French, which translates to&nbsp;Mr. Eat-All.</p><p><h2>Doctors performed X-rays, biopsies, and blood tests to&nbsp;determine what causes Lotito’s ability to&nbsp;digest metal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4f/7f9/87dcb05632beb0f24367728869.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Medical professionals</a> studied Lotito’s case and concluded that his digestive system was incredibly resilient, having an&nbsp;extra thick stomach lining and intestines. He&nbsp;could consume up&nbsp;to&nbsp;900 grams (2&nbsp;lbs.) of&nbsp;metal each day thanks to&nbsp;his powerful stomach juices. Moreover, as&nbsp;his stomach processed the metal fragments, the juices would usually take the hard edges off the metal&nbsp;— sort of&nbsp;acting like a&nbsp;natural sandpaper.</p><p>However, doctors shared that his body is&nbsp;just like everyone else’s, and they were unable to&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;definitive explanation for Lotito’s digestive superpowers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Lotito, the wife of&nbsp;Mr. Eat-All was always concerned when her husband would take a&nbsp;bathroom break. The metal pieces that would exit his body had a&nbsp;notable impact, gradually chipping away at&nbsp;the porcelain toilet bowl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbf/958/19b5dc598da085225fab266e12.jpg><p><h2>Lotito found the best way to&nbsp;make metal pieces easier to&nbsp;ingest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce2/fd6/d33dd650a597ab23b57ff1226d.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lotito’s</a> routine involved breaking the metal into smaller pieces, chugging them, and then washing them down with water and mineral oil. The oil would act as&nbsp;a&nbsp;lubricant and keep his throat safe from potential wounds.</p><p>Throughout his life, Mr. Eat-All had an&nbsp;impressive collection of&nbsp;non-perishable items ingested: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>18</a>&nbsp;bicycles, 7&nbsp;TV sets, 2&nbsp;beds, 15&nbsp;shopping trolleys, a&nbsp;computer, a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;skis, one waterbed, razors, bolts, and 6&nbsp;chandeliers. These might seem unbelievable at&nbsp;first, but the strangest achievement he&nbsp;had was eating a&nbsp;Cessna airplane; it&nbsp;took him 2&nbsp;years to&nbsp;eat&nbsp;it, piece by&nbsp;piece.</p><p>Surprisingly, Lotito had an&nbsp;aversion to&nbsp;soft foods, such as&nbsp;eggs and bananas and they made him sick, giving him heartburn and indigestion.</p><p><h2>It’s estimated that between 1959 and 1997, Mr. Eat-All had digested nearly nine tons of&nbsp;metal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e98/879/47687257f9b2604dbfe5dc6ce2.png><p>In&nbsp;1984, Lotito appeared in&nbsp;the Guinness World Records for the feat of&nbsp;having the most remarkable diet, earning him the title of&nbsp;<i>The Greatest Omnivore</i>. Notably, when GWR presented him with a&nbsp;commemorative plaque for his accomplishments, Lotito ate that, too.</p><p>Sadly, Michel Lotito passed away in&nbsp;2007, ate the age of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>57</a>, from natural causes. Doctors still can’t say for certain if&nbsp;his diet had anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with his passing. One thing is&nbsp;for sure&nbsp;— he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;dent in&nbsp;history and his unique story will live for centuries, proving how some humans can defy science, without a&nbsp;clear explanation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqmsdNmpKtllZbBbq3LpWStoJVitba5wKdkq52TrrCttc2gZKaZk522r7GMsJ%2BoZZGpsm6Fj2lkoKqRosBuu8VmpJ6skaF6psLEq7BmnJGuenl9lmxpcmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
