The fundraiser was held to raise emergency relief funds for both union and non-union crew members who are suffering financial setbacks due to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood strikes</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a fan-captured clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), the School of Rock star can be seen taking the stage for a stand-up comedy routine. Black then suddenly took off his shirt and tossed it on the ground. Surveying the crowd, he later asked if they have any song requests, prompting one fan to shout Swift’s “Anti-Hero.”</p><p>“I know that one. Everyone knows that f**king song,” he shot back.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The comedian then began belting out the chorus of the song. Apparently though, it seems that he didn’t entirely memorize the track’s lyrics as he later sang the wrong lines, still with the tune of “Anti-Hero.”</p><p>Black’s unserious performance admittedly eased up the saddening impact of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA</a> strikes. Many crew members have gone without a paycheck during the hiatus as tension remains between SAG-AFTRA and the studios. The Hollywood strike has lasted 104 days, the longest strike in SAG-AFTRA’s history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-releases-1989-taylor-s-version>Taylor Swift Releases 1989 (Taylor’s Version)</h2><p>On Friday, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> released the re-recording of her famous 2014 album&nbsp;1989.&nbsp;Dropped via Republic Records, new version of her fifth studio album presents reimagined versions of the deluxe edition of&nbsp;1989’s 16 original tracks. It also includes five “From the Vault” songs “Slut!,” “Say Don’t Go,” “Now That We Don’t Talk,” “Suburban Legends” and “Is It Over Now?”</p><p>To celebrate the milestone, Swift posted about the album on Instagram. The pop superstar uploaded a series of photos, opening up about the significance of re-recording her tracks.</p><p>“I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic would you sprinkle on my life for so long,” she wrote. “This moment is a reflection of the woods we’ve wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark. I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of&nbsp;1989. It’s been waiting for you.”</p><p>1989 (Taylor’s Version)&nbsp;comes months after Swift released Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)&nbsp;in July. In 2021, she dropped reimagined versions of Fearless and Red.</p><p>Recently, the pop singer celebrated celebrated her 10th No. 1 hit on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100 after her song&nbsp;“Cruel Summer”&nbsp;off 2019’s&nbsp;Lover&nbsp;peaked at the top of the chart.
