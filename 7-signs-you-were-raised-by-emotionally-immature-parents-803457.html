We at Bright Side believe it’s very important to work on your emotional intelligence. But let’s see what emotionally immature parents look like.
1. They only know how to take care of your physical needs.
Emotionally immature parents may be great at making sure their children’s basic needs are met."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But let’s see what emotionally immature parents look like.</p><p><h2>1. They only know how to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;your physical needs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/753/191/c060a850bbb761519bf7db269b.jpg><p>Emotionally immature parents may be&nbsp;great at&nbsp;making sure their children’s basic <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>needs</a> are met. They might provide them with food, a&nbsp;home, and education, and they’ll take care of&nbsp;them when they’re sick. But such parents aren’t very good at&nbsp;giving emotional support. When their child is&nbsp;worried or&nbsp;upset about something, they might dismiss those feelings because they cannot understand how a&nbsp;child who’s well-provided for could have any problems.</p><p><h2>2. They don’t know how to&nbsp;express their feelings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c5/15e/52f8a651beb116fa68f25cf2fd.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;expressing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deep</a> emotions, emotionally immature parents aren’t comfortable. A&nbsp;child needs to&nbsp;know that they’re loved, but such parents aren’t very good at&nbsp;showing affection. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the way they were raised themselves; if&nbsp;emotions weren’t something to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shared or&nbsp;talked about in&nbsp;their childhood. Then, later in&nbsp;life, they become afraid of&nbsp;appearing vulnerable or&nbsp;weak if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;connect with their child on&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper emotional level.</p><p><h2>3. They don’t tolerate differences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4e/966/2de46c5d929feb0924d12db372.jpg><p>Emotionally immature parents think they’re the only ones who know the right way to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things. If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a> opinion, there’s no&nbsp;point in&nbsp;negotiating to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;middle ground&nbsp;— your point of&nbsp;view will simply not be&nbsp;accepted. So&nbsp;when you were a&nbsp;child, you probably always had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things the way your parents wanted, and what they believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc6/12f/fa81035359bb3e80c201c413e1.jpg><p><h2>4. They act childish.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/543/3f9/b28b1d5d5d8273d4bb748f9daa.jpg><p>Because emotionally immature parents don’t know how to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>express</a> their emotions in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy way, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;tell how they feel. Still, they might expect their children to&nbsp;somehow know what emotions they’re experiencing and what they need. And if&nbsp;the child doesn’t know that, they might get upset and make the child feel guilty for not giving them what they wanted.</p><p><h2>5. They often lash out at&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86d/7c9/7e43cb5f36aa95ecea67e811b2.jpg><p>Part of&nbsp;not being able to&nbsp;express your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>emotions</a> correctly is&nbsp;not knowing how to&nbsp;control them. So&nbsp;emotionally immature parents might often lose their temper and even blame their child for anything that made them so&nbsp;upset. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, you probably were very careful about what you said or&nbsp;did around your parents because you were afraid it&nbsp;would make them angry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af3/e5c/517cc1539ea2aabdf31ab77bef.jpg><ul><li>When I&nbsp;was three years old, my&nbsp;dad was painting a&nbsp;room in&nbsp;the house. I&nbsp;accidentally stepped into some paint. Decades later, he&nbsp;still brings it&nbsp;up&nbsp;several times a&nbsp;year and is&nbsp;still angry at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Spartan2470&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>6. They don’t do&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the emotional work.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d66/b7f/d32e8f54fd9d88b97c1df8650f.jpg><p>Emotional <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>work</a> is&nbsp;what you do&nbsp;to&nbsp;maintain your relationship with someone. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;family with emotionally immature parents, the burden of&nbsp;doing this work falls on&nbsp;the child. It’s their job to&nbsp;fix a&nbsp;strained relationship, even if&nbsp;the reason it&nbsp;became strained wasn’t their fault. Their parents, on&nbsp;the other hand, might never admit they were wrong and apologize for their behavior.</p><p><h2>7. Their behavior is&nbsp;unstable.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04d/641/4ac5335c40831e08126cb1315d.jpg><p>Emotionally immature parents and their emotions are easily <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>influenced</a> by&nbsp;other people or&nbsp;other external factors. Their mood might change often, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the way they interact with their child. They might be&nbsp;very involved in&nbsp;their child’s life for a&nbsp;certain period of&nbsp;time and then suddenly become more disinterested and reserved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/93f/44c/d238355b7b9ef7fa19db4e50d4.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you recognize someone’s parents in&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the above situations?
