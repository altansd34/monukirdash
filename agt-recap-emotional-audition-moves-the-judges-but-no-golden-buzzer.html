Although the night ended with a moving performance with an emotional backstory, this week’s show didn’t feature a Golden Buzzer. However, it did include some pretty unconventional acts.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOcG59JOjI</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emotional-audition-moves-the-agt-judges-to-tears>Emotional Audition Moves the AGT Judges to Tears</h2><p>Tuesday night’s final performance came from an act called 2 Moms United by One Heart. The singing duo was made up of Holly and Kim, who were brought together after Holly’s son passed away, and his heart was donated to Kim’s son.</p><p>The moms discovered that they had both sung the song “For Good” from Wicked to their sons. That was the song they chose to sing together for their audition on America’s Got Talent. They shared that they want to spread the word about organ donation.</p><p>The women’s performance brought judges Sofia Vergara and Heidi Klum to tears. Howie Mandel admitted that he’s not usually a fan of musical theater, but he called it “the most magical moment I have ever experienced on America’s Got Talent.“</p><p>Although the judges gave the moms a standing ovation, none of them chose to hit the Golden Buzzer. They did, however, give the duo four “yes” votes to move on. We’ll have to wait and see if the next episode features a Golden Buzzer performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ogD1oFyHeE</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-audience-changed-the-judges-minds-this-week>The Audience Changed the Judges’ Minds This Week</h3><p>Tuesday’s episode proved just how much power the show’s audience has, as they managed to change two of the judges’ minds about a couple of the auditioning acts. The first one was an act called Poetic Flight that involved remote control airplanes.</p><p>Simon Cowell and Heidi Klum both buzzed the act mid-performance. However, Sofia Vergara and Howie Mandel loved it. With only two “yes” votes, they were at risk of going home. However, the audience convinced Cowell to change his mind and vote “yes.”</p><p>Later in the show, the Rybka Twins showed off an acrobatic dance routine that Mandel described as “corny.” Vergara also wasn’t convinced that they should go through, but she was swayed to vote “yes” thanks to the audience. The Rybka Twins went through with three votes.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ELECTRIC CELLIST HAS EVERYONE SMILING IN ‘AGT’ EARLY RELEASE AUDITION</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k_c6jhGvjk</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-week-featured-unconventional-talents>This Week Featured Unconventional Talents</h3><p>There were several surprising and unconventional talents on display during Tuesday’s show. Some of them were a hit, while others fell flat. The hits included electric cellist and singer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BJ Griffin</a>, contortion dance group <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Atai Show</a>, and aerial hand balancers Duo Just Two Men.</p><p>Then there was Enishi, who quickly changed his masks to look like the four judges. Although Cowell wasn’t impressed, the other three judges voted “yes” to sending him through. However, face yoga instructor Koko Hayashi wasn’t so lucky.</p><p>Vergara was excited to realize that she follows Koko on Instagram. The other judges weren’t as starstruck, as they all hit their red buzzers during Koko’s instructional performance. Mandel had to get up and hit Vergara’s buzzer so the act would stop. Koko didn’t make it through.</p><p>What was your favorite performance from this week’s episode of AGT? Were you disappointed there wasn’t a Golden Buzzer?
