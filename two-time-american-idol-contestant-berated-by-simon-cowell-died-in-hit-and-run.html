Both times she failed to impress the judges but certainly provided viewers with some good entertainment. After her second American Idol audition in 2009, Alexis tragically died.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alexis-cohen-auditioned-for-american-idol-twice>Alexis Cohen Auditioned For ‘American Idol’ Twice</h2><p>Alexis first auditioned for the seventh season of American Idol in Philadelphia. The artist was just 23 years old at the time when she declared that she likes to “march to the beat of a different drummer.” She was wearing sparkling glitter eyeshadow and star-shaped earrings to her audition. “I like the fact that people look at me with 12 heads,” she said before her audition. At the time, Alexis was studying to be a veterinarian.</p><p>Alexis sang “Somebody to Love” by Jefferson Airplane. “It was all a bit possessed for me,” Simon Cowell said. “I don’t think this is the route for you sweetheart.” He also suggested that perhaps Alexis should go down a country route or join a band. The judges all voted “no” which left Alexis heartbroken.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ CONTESTANT NIKKI MCKIBBIN TRAGICALLY PASSED AWAY —&nbsp;A LOOK AT HER LEGACY</a></strong></p><p>“Well Simon didn’t like me and he’s a big fat bad word, very very bad words,” Alexis said when she left the room. She also called Simon “egotistical.” Simon also had some harsh words for Alexis, comparing her to Willem Dafoe who played the Green Goblin in Spider-Man. She flipped off the camera before leaving the American Idol set.</p><p>Alexis made her big return to American Idol the following season in 2009. She decided to take a kinder approach in this second audition and introduced herself to other hopefuls in the waiting room. This time she sang “Like A Prayer” by Madonna. Simon called it “utterly horrendous.” She once again flipped the bird to Simon and cursed on her way out of the audition room.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alexis-died-in-a-hit-and-run-after-her-second-audition>Alexis Died In A Hit And Run After Her Second Audition</h3><p>In July 2009, Alexis <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was struck and killed by a driver</a> in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. An autopsy report revealed that she suffered chest, head and abdominal injuries. Daniel Bark was arrested and charged with reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident. He pleaded guilty to drunk driving and eluding police. Aggravated manslaughter and other charges were dismissed after police failed to read him his rights. According to The Daily News, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>accepted a plea deal after spending 20 months in jail.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Alexis is one of the American Idol contestants that we lost over the years.
