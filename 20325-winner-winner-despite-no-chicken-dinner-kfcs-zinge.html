Logistical reasons were put forward as the explanation for the shortage, with KFC’s new delivery supplier DHL taking the brunt of the blame.
Though the situation could have proven disastrous, KFC has managed to emerge from the incident with its reputation intact thanks to its clever, light-hearted and apologetic advertising strategy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This was followed by a short apology which began with: “A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It’s not ideal.”</p><p>While KFC limited damage to its reputation, it’s also spent a week being talked about. KFC’s word of mouth score (whether you have talked about the brand with friends or family) has jumped from 11 to 37.</p><p>KFC’s purchase consideration score (would you consider buying from KFC?) has stayed solidly at the 18 mark, underling the limited damage to the brand.</p><p>Image Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmWAc4GMsKCnppWneri1zaecq2WUmsCxtdOeZKenXZi1qq%2FKnqVmnJmju6a%2BjKSdnKtdr7avs8Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
