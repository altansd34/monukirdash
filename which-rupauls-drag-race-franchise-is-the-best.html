When different countries decided to create their own version, it proceeded to take over the world as years moved onward.</strong></p><p>Over the years, many Drag Race franchises attempted to entertain a variety of audiences. Yet, there are ones which incredibly stood out among all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drag-race-espana-is-the-most-mind-blowing-version-of-the-show>Drag Race España is the Most Mind-Blowing Version of the Show</h2><p>Hear this out: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drag Race España</a> may not automatically ring a bell, but it does deserve the highest hype. When it kicked off its first ever season in 2021, it immediately produced some of the most iconic moments drag moments in history. Season one saw what the queens of Spain can offer, decidedly launching avant-garde and unpredictable works of art.</p><p>It’s no surprise that season two slayed hard like the first—the version established a solid foundation for them to follow. Talent and artistry mixed with the right drama were consistently overflowing, giving fans the best scenes on screen. The second season displayed burlesque, keytar, fast food temptation, and several unique bangers that boggled the minds of the audience. I mean, who didn’t squeak when Onyx revealed herself from a space egg and gave birth to an alien baby right on stage? That, I have to say, is ridiculously fantastic.</p><p>Yet, we have to admit that season three didn’t impressively live up to the expectations. <a href=#>Edi</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href=#>ing choices</a> were a bit wonky and chemistry between the queens needs to be more manifest. This nonetheless wouldn’t discount the fact that the season three drag queens possess phenomenal talent.</p><p>Understandably, international fans may not instantly be interested in watching this franchise due to language barrier, but once they’ve given this version a chance, regret will be out of the group chat. Indeed, the high-quality success of Drag Race España is not something we saw coming, but we’re definitely here for it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-s-drag-race-remain-to-be-the-core-series>RuPaul’s Drag Race Remain to be the Core Series</h2><p>Of course, who would ever dare discredit the one that started it all? Drag Race franchises wouldn’t even be possible if not for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>. It has given rise to multiple generations of queers who became out and proud to showcase their drag.</p><p>RuPaul’s Drag Race did not only become popular to the LGBTQIA+ community. It has also introduced the existence of drag to mainstream media, giving gays a chance to shine in several platforms.</p><p>Not to mention, its spin-off RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars gave rise to the more improved drag queens. This twist proved to be worth every watch as it has introduced fans to the most entertaining realm of drama and talent. More importantly, it’s admittedly been amazing to see how the queens’ careers have progressed since they first ever stepped the Drag Race stage.</p><p>Indeed, RuPaul’s Drag Race is an engraved series in the world of entertainment. As one of the various shows that seek to provide space for a marginalized community like the LGBTQIA+ sector, it’s not only there to give joy, it’s there to make history.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CharliDAmelio_MarkBallas_ABCEricMcCandless-220x176.jpg alt="Top 10 Best ‘Dancing With The Stars’ Winners — Ranked" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGgnKBdp8KxrdSlqmacopa0br7AnJxmnqKWu6S0yKycZqGjYsGpsYybnKysXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
