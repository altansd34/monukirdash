While the three of them are picking up questions and answering them, fans can’t help but notice the obvious chemistry between Durant and Stewart.</p><p>When a fan asked Durant to demonstrate his speaking voice again to the camera, Stewart made a comment that had fans going. Durant was initially reluctant to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speak</a> admitting that he didn’t want to be bothersome with his voice but did so anyway, and Stewart’s comments seemingly made it all worth it.</p><p>“I love your voice, and I said this the last time, that I love your laugh, and my name it just sounds perfect.” Stewart said to Durant.</p><p>Durant also made hints about their friendship, while answering a question on whether they have nicknames for each other. The CODA actor revealed what he always calls Stewart in their texts.</p><p>“I just thought of something, if we’re texting, I call her B-shine.” Durant revealed. “Because that’s like the sign, it’s the shine from my heart.”</p><p>Their fans that commented couldn’t help but root for the two to get together, seen in most of the comments of the video. Although both of them chose to ignore the messages, it certainly occupied most of the comments section.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Durant Opens Up About Special Connection with Stewart</h2><p>The deaf actor shared his thoughts about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dance partner</a> by revealing that they developed an incredible friendship in DWTS. He said that Stewart was there for him every step of the way even when he felt like he could be overcome by nervousness.</p><p>“Before the show I always have a bit of nerves, I have butterflies in my stomach,” Durant admitted. “As soon as the door opened, and I laid eyes on Britt and I could see her smiling and feel her warmth I knew that we would be a great team.”</p><p>Stewart on the other hand has been learning to do American Sign Language for better communication and teamwork with Durant. She has also planned to take proper ASL classes in the future, and continues to hang out with Durant.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_HowieMandel_Leon-BennettGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Howie Mandel Speaks Truth About His Mental Disorder In New Paramount+ Series" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWknbavt4ysp5qqm6h6uLHRnmSfpKmeu6h5w66poqaXYq%2BztdOtZKyslayus8CMnZinoZWheqXB0Zqlratdp7Kksc2tZKKmo6muqL7ApmSloaaafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
