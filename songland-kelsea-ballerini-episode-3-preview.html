Plus, there’s a preview of one of the original song, “Crush.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfJxuyXetXk</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Daniel Feels</h4><p>Daniel Feels is a singer/songwriter based in Los Angeles. He has already released an EP and a few singles as well, which can be found on <a href=#>SoundCloud</a>. His vibe seems to be pop-y with some strong, powerful beats.</p><p>For Kelsea Ballerini, Daniel sang an original song called “Crush.” The song is super catchy and fun! Kelsea and <a href=#>Ester Dean</a> instantly compliment it. Then, <a href=#>Shane McAnally</a> and <a href=# class=broken_link>Ryan Tedder</a> decide to break it down some, giving a more simple backtrack for Kelsea. They all encourage him to “strip it down,” but say it is a JAM! I have to agree. The mentors are definitely on to something here and I hope Ryan gets to work with him more. Daniel is definitely a strong contender for this episode.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Newsome</h4><p>Jack Newsome is also a singer/songwriter in LA. He has previous performed at The Voice‘s <a href=# class=broken_link>Open Mic Night</a> there! It’s very possible that that experience is what brought him into the NBC family for Songland. Jack is a current student at the Berklee College of Music. During him time there, he has managed to release original music, as well as feature in songs like <a href=#>“Said the Sky & Origami”</a> by Affection. He also has a <a href=#>YouTube channel</a> with covers and original songs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWZB3Zghy2/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jess Jocoy</h4><p>Jess Jocoy is originally from Washington but currently lives in Nashville. She graduated from Belmont University in 2017 with a major in Songwriting. Jess is now a project manager at Rounder Records. While her trip out to LA for Songland might have been her first exposure to the city, she is not new to creating original music. Jess’s most recent original is called <a href=#>“Hope (Such a Long Way).”</a> She seems to be, stylistically, the most similar to Kelsea Ballerini from the pack. Her songs skew a little more country-sounding than the rest of this pop-heavy group.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxdms_zBiNg/</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Darius Coleman</h4><p>Darius is a native of Philadelphia. He was a songwriter on the hit FOX show, Empire. One of his original songs, <a href=#>“SunDown,”</a> was also featured in a Cadillac corporate recap video and the car company’s music event. He has a new song, “High of U,” set to release just a few days after his episode airs. On top of all that, Darius was invited to sing at a private party for Songland, per his <a href=#>Instagram</a>! Could that be a good sign for him?</p><p>We won’t know more until tomorrow night when Kelsea Ballerini finds her next hit from one of these songwriters!
