Let’s get to know him more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-oliver-steele-grew-up-surrounded-with-music>Oliver Steele Grew Up Surrounded with Music</h2><p>Raised in the town of Mt. Juliet Tennessee, Oliver’s artistic inclination is almost inevitable. His father Toby was a professional guitar player who ensured to unleash his musicality, filling his days with tunes from the day he was born. According to his website bio, his father stuffed his memories with “stories of collaborating with legendary musicians.” It is thus no wonder why he possesses the capacity to exude raw emotions every time he sings.</p><p>Back in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">audition</a> on American Idol season 21, Oliver performed Eric Clapton’s “Change The World” while his father was present. This has apparently evoked the judges to tears, consequently obtaining a golden ticket.</p><p>“You could win this thing,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Perry</a> said.</p><p>Oliver’s dad was a singer-songwriter who suffered a stroke, consequently affecting the left side of his body. Having a dear bond with his father, Toby has become one of Oliver’s motivations to continue pursuing his passion in music.</p><p>“At the age of 24, the young singer-songwriter has just begun to make his mark in the music world and around Music City after honing his craft as a singer, musician, and songwriter over the past few years,” his bio reads.</p><p>As of writing, Oliver has already dropped two songs, one being a cover of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Styles</a>‘ hit “As It Was.” He then followed this up with an original song titled “Too Soon.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Made It to The Top 12 of American Idol</h2><p>Oliver has undeniably been one of the most consistent contestants in the competition. Indeed his dynamic country vocals are a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>After American Idol confirmed that he’s in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 12</a>, Oliver sang “You’re Still The One” by Shania Twain. Putting his own spin to the song, he has successfully made a worthy rendition of the song. This version has understandably sealed an approval from judge Luke Bryan.</p><p>“I keep proving myself wrong, I keep second guessing myself, and I think it’s about time for that to stop,” he said.</p><p>Oliver Steele is definitely not going to back out from the Top 12 of the competition. We expect his performances to get better and better as time goes on. To know more about his journey, be sure to tune into American Idol, airing every Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern on ABC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/Vg71-VQGwag</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_MileyCyrus_Stefanie-KeenanGetty-Images-for-Daily-Front-Row-220x147.jpeg alt="Miley Cyrus Has Returned to Her Brunette Roots and The Internet is Not Okay" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>oliver steele</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWfoba3sdFmqq2dlaGybsDHnmSoppVixKm7jJymrqSUYsSquoyapJ6qmZiur3nInaalZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
