Do you dream of spending a month practicing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a> in Paris, or a year immersing yourself in the language and lifestyle of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a>? A dream is nothing without a plan behind it, so you’ll need to understand the cost of living in Europe vs. the US before you take the plunge.</p><p>Of course, Europe is a large continent of 44 different counties, each offering unique opportunities and varying costs of living. Let’s take a look at how much it’ll cost you to live in different parts of Europe.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-cost-of-living-in-Europe-by-country>The cost of living in Europe by country</h2><p>Before we get into this, a quick note on how to understand the cost of living index. We’re using numbers from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Numbeo</a>, where New York City is the basis for comparison and has a score of 100. So, if a country scores higher than 100, it means that it is on average more expensive than New York City in terms of consumer goods prices, which include groceries, restaurants, transportation and utilities. These index numbers don’t include rent, so your mileage may vary depending on where you find accommodation.</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Country</strong></td><td><strong>Cost of Living Index</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>123.3</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>100.9</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>84.1</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>76.1</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>74.1</td></tr><tr><td>United Kingdom</td><td>69.7</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>66.5</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>65.6</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>56.2</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>53.9</td></tr><tr><td>Czech Republic</td><td>48.2</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>47.9</td></tr><tr><td>Kosovo</td><td>27.1</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As you can see, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Switzerland</a> and Norway rank as the most expensive countries in Europe according to the cost of living index; prices in both countries are on average higher than in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>In every other country in Europe, the average cost of living is lower than in NYC. Portugal, a favorite retirement destination for many Europeans, has the lowest cost of living in Western Europe. If you’re looking for the absolute lowest cost of living in Europe, turn your attention toward the Balkan state of Kosovo.</p><p>Be aware that costs within each country may vary widely. Larger cities, for example, are generally more expensive than rural areas.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-much-does-it-cost-to-live-in-Europe-for-a-month?>How much does it cost to live in Europe for a month?</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the answer depends a lot on where you live. Let’s look at the average cost of living for one month in several European cities.</p><p>These costs assume that you are a single person living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, or a family of four living in a three-bedroom apartment in the city center. Remember that these costs represent an average, not a prediction. Only you know your lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=1.5770925110132><tr readability=4><td><strong>City</strong></td><td><strong>Cost of living for a single person (USD)</strong></td><td><strong>Cost of living for a family of four (USD)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Zurich</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$4,000</a></td><td>$10,400</td></tr><tr><td>London</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,600</a></td><td>$8,300</td></tr><tr><td>Paris</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2,440</a></td><td>$7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Berlin</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2,400</a></td><td>$6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rome</td><td><a href=#>$2,0</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">0</a><a href=#>0</a></td><td>$5,500</td></tr><tr><td>Lisbon</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2,000</a></td><td>$4,800</td></tr><tr><td>Madrid</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$1,874</a></td><td>$4,600</td></tr><tr><td>Athens</td><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$1,375</a></td><td>$3,800</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As you can see, costs vary widely depending on where you want to live. Living in <a href=#>Zurich</a>, you’ll need a fairly high salary to lead a comfortable lifestyle. Moving south — especially to Portugal, Spain or Greece — could lower your costs substantially.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Where-can-I-live-cheaply-in-Europe?>Where can I live cheaply in Europe?</h2><p>As most Americans moving to Europe choose to live in Western Europe, we’ll focus there.&nbsp;</p><p>First, you can save money by renting an apartment outside of the city center. As European cities tend to have excellent public transport networks, living in the suburbs is a great way to save money and still enjoy a city’s cultural offerings.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, you can choose a country with a lower cost of living (again, that’s Greece, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain</a> and Portugal).&nbsp;</p><p>You can also save a lot by choosing to not live in the largest cities. For example:</p><ul><li>Rather than <strong>Paris</strong>, you could settle in <strong>Toulouse</strong>, where the weather is better and the cost of living is more than 23% lower.&nbsp;</li><li>Instead of <strong>Lisbon</strong>, why not head to lovely <strong>Porto</strong>, where the cost of living is 15% lower?&nbsp;</li><li>If you’re intent on living in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German-speaking country</a>, consider Austria. The cost of living in <strong>Vienna</strong> is around 18% lower than in <strong>Berlin</strong> and 52% lower than in <strong>Zurich</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Over in the UK, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>London</strong></a> has always been a favorite destination, but living in booming <strong>Manchester</strong> will reduce your cost of living by a whopping 32%. That’s a lot of spare change for fish and chips.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to move to Europe?</h2><p>Now that you know the average cost of living in several major European countries, you should feel better prepared to choose where you might want to settle. Northern European countries — plus Switzerland! — tend to have the highest costs of living, while those in the south are generally cheaper places to live. By broadening your horizons, you might find it easier to make your goal of living in Europe come true.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
