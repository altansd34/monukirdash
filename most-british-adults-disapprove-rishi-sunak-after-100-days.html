Inflation remains stubbornly above 10%, while major <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>transport and health care strikes</a> rock the country just as members of his own party want Sunak to cut funding to some of those same services.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Inside No. 10 Downing St., Sunak has also <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>struggled to keep his ducks in a row</a>. Cabinet Minister Gavin Williamson left office in November over bullying allegations, for which Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab is also being investigated. And on Sunday, Sunak sacked Conservative Party Chairman Nadhim Zahawi over a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>previously undisclosed multimillion-dollar tax dispute</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sunak replaced Zahawi with Greg Hands, giving him a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>mandate to prepare the party for elections</a> that must be held by January 2025. He also reshuffled his Cabinet to reflect a shift of priorities away from signing post-Brexit trade agreements to focus on a wider investment strategy.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The move is being portrayed as Sunak finally putting his own mark on the government, but he has a long way to go to avoid a trouncing: Politico’s Poll of Polls shows Labour running ahead by <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>more than 20 percentage points</a> in a hypothetical contest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOpqasrF2Xv6rAyKyfZpmUqrm1v4ydoKyZoKW%2FsMLEZqmiq5ieerTBzZqiZpmWqbKzeZBpZ2acka7A</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
