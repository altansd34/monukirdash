She was diagnosed with arthritis that from then on&nbsp;started literally ruining her body.</p><p>She changed many doctors, and with time it&nbsp;became impossible for her to&nbsp;even wear heels. This was her personal tragedy, as&nbsp;she’s always been an&nbsp;actress who always wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;her own stunts. But Kathleen never gave up&nbsp;and reinvented herself in&nbsp;her forties becoming a&nbsp;stage actor. She won a&nbsp;huge public <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for her performances in&nbsp;<i>Cat On&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hot Tin Roof</i> on&nbsp;Broadway and <i>The Graduate</i> in&nbsp;London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc9/63c/d05042567299eac4d0cf989df9.jpg><p>When the ravaging effects of&nbsp;arthritis and medications <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>caused</a> her to&nbsp;bloat and gain weight, her looks were the last thing that bothered her. Her main concern at&nbsp;that time was about surviving. People were cruel to&nbsp;her and even accused her of&nbsp;having bad habits.</p><p>After she passed out while in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the rehearsals in&nbsp;2002, she finally admitted her problems, finished the show’s run and then went to&nbsp;rehab.</p><p><h2>Kathleen remains faithful to&nbsp;herself and says “no” to&nbsp;surgeries and Botox.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b9/159/f8f7075348914dc31a8758e77e.jpg><p>Kathleen Turner is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge fan of&nbsp;natural beauty. She openly speaks that she has never tried to&nbsp;change herself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;attractive for others. She’s never had <a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> or&nbsp;plastic surgeries.</p><p>In&nbsp;her interview, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “<strong>No&nbsp;one is&nbsp;sexy if&nbsp;they don’t like themselves.</strong> I&nbsp;don’t care how they look. When High Definition photography came out on&nbsp;film everybody thought they looked fat and the Botox craze started. It’s destructive. You see a&nbsp;perfectly good actor who suddenly can’t move their forehead or&nbsp;their eyebrows. How do&nbsp;you act without eyebrows? I&nbsp;can’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/886/37a/2d24085f1ebe590cde6511617b.jpg><p>She’s never been a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diets</a> either. Once, a&nbsp;producer sent her a&nbsp;box of&nbsp;diet food, and she turned it&nbsp;back.</p><p>“I&nbsp;taped the box up&nbsp;and sent it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;his office. It&nbsp;contained diet salad dressing, diet potato chips. I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;enjoy life. I&nbsp;like food. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;spend 15&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;my&nbsp;day wondering how I&nbsp;look. For some people, men and women, that’s their primary focus and that’s so&nbsp;boring,” says Kathleen.</p><p>She didn’t tell anyone she was sick with the arthritis for a&nbsp;very long time. “I&nbsp;fear being vulnerable in&nbsp;people’s eyes. I’ve trained myself so&nbsp;that now when somebody says, ’I’m going to&nbsp;help you,’ I&nbsp;say ’Yes’ and make myself think of&nbsp;what they can&nbsp;do. My&nbsp;automatic response in&nbsp;the past was ’No.’”</p><p>If&nbsp;you are looking for another portion of&nbsp;inspiration, you may want to&nbsp;find out about these celebs who’ve never had any <a href=#>cosmetic surgeries</a>, but still look awesome as&nbsp;years go&nbsp;by. Their example may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life ode to&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural look.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLiiwMelnJ6mXanCs7rEq2SsrJGnerCyjKycq6GRoXquu8xmn5qrXZy8r7GMrZ%2Brp6WctW65wKewZpyfrLu0ecinZKWhlpp6o8HTZpmem5Gism6tjKucmqRdnru0vMirmK2hn6N6eX2ScnBqZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
