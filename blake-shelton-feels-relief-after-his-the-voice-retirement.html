They began dating the following year after they separated from their respective exes Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale.</p><p>In a previous interview, the country singer stated that he and Stefani have done “so much traveling and touring and work the first half of our lives.” Now, he’s ready to enjoy a cozy life, “put my sweatpants on at 6 p.m. and watch Ozark eight times.”</p><p>“If I walked away from my career at this time, the only thing that I run the risk of is having regrets that I’m missing out on some more important things in life. For now, that’s our kids. This isn’t about me anymore and never will be again,” he said.</p><p>The “Honey Bee” singer officially bid farewell from The Voice after the May 23 finale. Stefani, on the other hand, will be coming back to the show as coach for season 24. The blonde beauty will sit on the iconic red chair alongside John Legend, Niall Horan and first-time coach Reba McEntire.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-gives-sneak-peek-of-his-farm-life>He Gives Sneak Peek of His Farm Life</h2><p>Apart from bonding with his family, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">country star</a> also spends most of his time in his Oklahoma farm. In a video he posted on Instagram, Shelton tagged his fans along his hilarious seed-planting process.</p><p>“Got my old friend out of the barn today!!! It’s Kubota time people. Kubota time…. #kubota #farming,” he wrote.</p><p>In the video, Shelton can be seen riding a Kubota tractor on the fields of his ranch as he comically sings a parody of the 4 Non Blondes’ hit “What’s Up.”</p><p>“I’m writing this song as I’m planting my seed. I ain’t got time to stop and I might’ve just peed,” he sang.</p><p>Despite reaching A-level status in the field of country music, Shelton has maintained his genuine cowboy roots. On his social media, he continues to share photos and videos taken at his farm, showing followers how he grows vegetables and flowers.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_BrandonLeake_Mike-CoppolaGetty-Images-for-Bob-Woodruff-Foundation-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Winner Brandon Leake Robbed of Car, Laptop, Hard Drive — Announces New Era" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaelZq5tHnRnqOinZZirqfAxKtkoaGjYsGpsYyvpqKblWK%2FpsDIq5ymnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
