The emotive aspect of the song, however, wouldn’t easily be noticed unless one gets to reflect on its lyrics.</p><p>Recently, the singer hosted a Q&A on his Instagram with his fans, thus giving more details about his new single. As stated by him, the song may be dynamic in terms of beat, but its lyrics sends across a deep meaning.</p><p>“I absolutely love this new song,” he said. “It’s an emotional one. It’s uptempo, but the lyrics are meaningful and the energy is there.”</p><p>Phillips described the song as a “reflection of love in the past few years.” Furthermore, it’s about knowing someone along with their struggles and witnessing how they conquer the same.</p><p>With this song, the American Idol alum seemingly went back to indie rock, which he was so into back when he kicked off his career. Several electric elements have been incorporated, but the folk sound wasn’t lost, nevertheless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-confesses-realizations-amid-wife-s-sick-state>He Confesses Realizations Amid Wife’s Sick State</h2><p>Suffering from an unspecified sickness, Phillips’s wife has become his inspiration in creating the song. In turn, the musician unfortunately had to witness her go through a painful medical process. This comes with knowing that he cannot fix such struggle despite he wants to. Eventually though, Phillips realized that he shouldn’t beat himself up for it.</p><p>“I want to make things as perfect as I can for her, but me realizing I can’t is very tough for me. I came to realize I have to just be there for her,” he said. “Sometimes not even saying anything. Just being there and go through it all with her,”</p><p>On Instagram, the singer expressed his appreciation for the support of his fans. He then teased fans that they should stay tune for more, not specifically mentioning what’s up. Nonetheless, fans do know that Phillips is currently working on a 2023 album.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_CharliePuth_Mireya-AciertoGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Battle Advisor Charlie Puth Announces New Concert Tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z6GgpaSZpXqxtMilo6Koo2K0psDSZpuenaChxm68xKuqqKaRoXq4tdOhZKedp2LAqrrGpZxmnJGjsKq6xmauoqyYYsawwdFmqqGZlKTEtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
