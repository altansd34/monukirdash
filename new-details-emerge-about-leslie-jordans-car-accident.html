Now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> has shared new details of Monday’s incident.</p><p>According to the the Los Angeles Fire Department, they responded to a 911 call about a car accident in the 900 block of North Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. They arrived to discover that Jordan’s car had hit a curb and a tree.</p><p>“There’s a man in a four-door BMW, in a grey vehicle, that crashed against the building,”&nbsp;a caller can be heard saying in the 911 call obtained by ET. “There’s other people trying to open the car door and to get this gentleman out.”</p><p>The LAFD found Jordan without a pulse and not breathing. They removed him from his car and administered CPR and defibrillation. Advanced life support measures reportedly continued for over 40 minutes, until it was determined that Jordan died at the scene at 9:38 a.m.</p><p>According to ET, the County of Los Angeles Department Medical Examiner’s coroner will determine the exact cause, time, and manner of Jordan’s death.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER,’ ‘RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE’ CAST PAY TRIBUTE TO LESLIE JORDAN</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jordan-was-reportedly-on-his-way-to-call-me-kat-set>Jordan Was Reportedly on His Way to Call Me Kat Set</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> has released a new report stating that Jordan was on his way to the Call Me Kat set when he got into the accident. The actor appears on the sitcom as a character named Phil, the head baker at Kat’s (Mayim Bialik) cafe.</p><p>Sources said people involved in the show became concerned when Jordan hadn’t shown up more than an hour after his call time. They apparently tried to figure out where he was before learning he had passed away.</p><p>TMZ also reports that, according to sources, Jordan had been complaining of shortness of breath over the past three weeks, and he had scheduled an appointment with a cardiologist. Investigators’ current theory is reportedly that Jordan suffered a heart attack while driving.</p><p>Production on Call Me Kat has been paused following Jordan’s death.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_KimKardashianShoot_Skims.jpeg alt="Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum Strip Down For SKIMS Photo Shoot in New ‘Kardashians’ Episode" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>leslie jordan</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6uZpyVqa6quNJmnKadopyybq3BqKytZZyawK21xGahqKqUlru0ecKaqWaZk5i2pbHNrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
