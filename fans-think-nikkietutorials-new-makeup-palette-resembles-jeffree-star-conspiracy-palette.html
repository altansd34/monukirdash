NikkieTutorials, whose real name is Nikkie de Jager, gushed about the 20 pan palette in a YouTube video and revealed its deeply personal meaning. But, some of her fans feel like it strikes a resemblance to Jeffree Star’s “Conspiracy” collaboration with Shane Dawson.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEZonnop-po/</p></figure><p>“Temple Tutorials” is the name of the palette. It has a duo cover featuring a dark design and a light design.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does NikkieTutorials Palette Bare A Resemblance To Jeffree Star’s Palette?</h2><p>Once the palette was revealed, speculation already began as to whether or not Nikkie’s palette looks like Jeffree’s. “Is it me or are a lot of colors similar to the conspiracy palette???????” one person asked in the comments on makeup page Trendmood’s Instagram. This sparked several people to chime in about how the range of colors looks similar to Jeffree’s palette. “The pink, purple, yellow, orange, red, light blue, ivy white and the neutrals. It’s very similar” said another comment. However, others defended the palette saying “it’s an easy trap to fall into because both palettes were an attempt to cater to everyone. Both palettes have punchy rainbow-y shades, staple neutral shades, and some interesting metallics, all of which are going to appeal to many different types of makeup users.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>TWITTER THINKS JEFFREE STAR’S RELATIONSHIP IS A PUBLICITY STUNT TO EXCUSE RACIST BEHAVIOR</a></strong></p><p>In 2016 Nikkie announced her collaboration with Too Faced Cosmetics&nbsp;on a limited-edition makeup line. Her feud with Jeffree started when he revealed some contractual details of her Too Faced deal that went awry when people felt <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the products had poor quality.</a> However, when Nikkie was blackmailed into coming out as transgender earlier this year, Jeffree lent his support. “YOU are such an inspiration and so f*cking brave! Love you and I’m so proud to call you a friend,” he tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEZtiwxBqzf/</p></figure><p>Do you think the palettes look alike?

It was named<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> after her brother that died in 2018 </a>at the age of 14. He had been battling lymphatic cancer. Another shade in the palette is named Pride. This shade was inspired by the transgender Pride flag. After coming out, Nikkie received tremendous support and has become a huge advocate for trans lives. Another shade is called Mr. Tutorials, to show her love for her fiancé Dylan.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>NIKKIETUTORIALS EXPOSES ELLEN DEGENERES FOR LETTING HER USE THE BATHROOM ON SHOW</a></strong></p><p>Will you be buying the “Temple Tutorials” palette?
