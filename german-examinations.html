Here you can see a table comparing the different exams according to the 6 levels of proficiency established by the CEFR, as well as a brief explanation of each one of them. As you will see, and as we have mentioned before, the TestDaF and the DSH exams are test for upper-intermediate and advanced users (B2-C1 level). On the contrary, Goethe-Institut offers 6 different exams, one for each CEFR level.</p><p>If you are not taking the exam for a specific purpose, but just to have a certificate to prove the level of German you have achieved so far, Goethe-Institut examinations could be the best option. The Goethe-Institut is the world’s leading institution for the promotion of the German language and culture. The certificates they issue are recognised and highly valued by employers and schools worldwide. To take one of these exams, you need to know in advance which level you are aiming to achieve. Unlike TestDaF and DSH, where the level of your certificate depends on your test score, Goethe examinations are designed for specific levels. This means that, if you pass it, you will only get a certificate of the level they have been designed for.</p><p>If you wish to apply for a place at a German university, you will need to sit the TestDaF or the DSH exam. Both are quite similar and cover the same range of CEFR levels (B2-C1). However, there are some differences that you should take into account. The first one is about where to take the test: whilst you can take the TestDaF in your home country (it’s offered in more than 90 countries around the world), you can only sit the DSH in Germany. Both exams have similar formats and evaluate the candidates in the 4 basic skills: reading, writing, listening and speaking. Second, if you take the DSH you will also have to solve a specific grammar section, which is not part of the TestDaF. The third diffence is that the exam fees depend on the country and institution, but TestDaF is usually slightly more expensive.</p><p>Another aspect in which TestDaF and DSH differ are the results. Candidates taking the TestDaF need to pass every single part of the exam in order to be successful in the overall exam. However, to fulfil the language requirements in the DSH exam it only matters if you get a pass in the total grade. This means, for example, that if you fail the listening part but have a really good grade in the speaking, you can still get your DSH certificate. The results from TestDaF usually take longer to be issued than those from the DSH. Apart from that, since every German university has their own admissions policy, the score they require in the whole test or each subtest can depend and the best would be to check directly with the admissions department of each of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57xKdmnKeeqbKvwI6gnKulkaN6psTApqCnmaSevK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
