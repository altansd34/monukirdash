In a voiceover, Cannon shares that he’s had a “decade of close calls, blood transfusions, chemotherapy, and hospitalizations.”</p><p>“Throughout this journey, I had to change everything about the way I live my life, and it wasn’t easy,” Cannon explained, before cutting to a clip in which he talks about his renal diet. Although he wanted to eat cupcakes and Cheetos, he had to stick to fruits and vegetables.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>HEAR THE SOUNDTRACK TO NICK CANNON’S MOVIE ‘MIRACLES ACROSS 125TH STREET’</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-has-cannon-handled-his-diagnosis-over-the-years>How Has Cannon Handled His Diagnosis Over the Years?</h3><p>“Like the phoenix rising through the ashes, I felt my strength coming back,” Cannon says in a voiceover. “Day by day, I laid a foundation both mentally and physically to build back the life that I had almost lost to this disease.
