The special episode featured each of the stars’ best Prom Night stories.</strong></p><p>This episode was particularly difficult for pairs, since they had to learn two more styles on top of their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prom Night</a> dance. This night truly brought various celebrities ahead of their castmates with the added marathon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Two Celebrities Hit Icon Status</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shangela</a> totally transformed for prom night. The drag star was seen dressed as none other than Jennifer Lopez and she totally owned it. Gleb Savchenko and Shangela performed a Foxtrot to “Waiting For Tonight” by Lopez. This dance was energetic and loaded with highly technical moves. The pair earned 35 out of 40 points.</p><p>Jordin Sparks was the other icon on the episode. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> winner performed to her own hit song “No Air” featuring Chris Brown. Her and Brandon Armstrong performed an emotional contemporary to the song, which earned 35 out of 40 points.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-perfect-scores-are-given>Two Perfect Scores Are Given</h2><p>Gabby Windey and Val Chmerkovskiy were definitely one of the most surprising pairs of the night. Their sultry Tango to “Good Girls Go Bad” by Cobra Starship feat.&nbsp;Leighton Meester earned the first perfect score of the season. The pair was absolutely shocked to get the highest possible score in the ballroom.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Brady</a> and Witney Carson was the pair to earn a perfect score in the season. After impressing throughout the weeks, they performed a quick yet technical Samba to “It Takes Two,” by&nbsp;Rob Base&nbsp;and&nbsp;DJ EZ Rock. Judges absolutely loved this performance, the perfect score was totally deserved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dance Marathon Brings The Best Out of Pairs</h2><p>The highly anticipated dance marathon brought out the best of the pairs. The prom theme continued while all of the couples battled it out in the styles of the Hustle and the Lindy Hop. After eliminating several pairs, the final two were Jessie James Decker and Alan Bersten and Shangela and Gleb.</p><p>Jessie made the ultimate comeback this week. Her and Alan Bersten were crowned as Prom King and Queen at the end of the night, 11 points was added to their overall score. This was absolutely insane to see, since the couple hasn’t been on the top of the leaderboard yet.</p><p>The bottom two pairs of the episode were Heidi D’Amelio and Artem Chigvintsev, and Joseph Baena and Daniella Karagach. Although both couples gave great performances tonight, they were pretty low on the leaderboard. Heidi and Artem scored 33 out of 40 points on their lighthearted “Girl’s Just Wanna Have Fun” Jazz routine, while Joseph and Daniella scored a 32 out of 40 points on their energetic Cha-Cha to “Shut Up and Dance.”</p><p>These pairs were rather surprising, even the judges couldn’t decide which couple should go home. On the brink of a tie, Len Goodman was able to decide which team would be saved. The head judge decided to save Heidi and Artem.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars returns to Disney+ for their next live performance on Monday, October 25. The upcoming episode is themed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Bublé</a> Night. In addition to the theme, the singer will sit on the judging panel.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BritneySpears_Nude.jpg alt="Britney Spears Posts Nude Photo on Twitter, Fans Are Divided" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWimrCivIyrnKKfnp67qHnMoqmrp6KXrq24jJyfmqWgYrGiusieo6WZXaCus63GmpqhZZqkwKa8x2aZmp2elnqou8SsZKGnnZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
