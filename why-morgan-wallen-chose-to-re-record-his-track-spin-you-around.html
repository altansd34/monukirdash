Unfortunately, I&nbsp;signed&nbsp;both deals without any legal representation.”</p><p>Wallen explained that he made 13 songs as part of this deal, five of which were released on an EP called Stand Alone, including the fan favorite track “Spin You Around.” He shared that his former colleagues were releasing a “10th Anniversary” edition of the EP against his wishes, featuring eight bonus tracks.</p><p>“For months I’ve been exploring every avenue possible to acquire the rights to&nbsp;this&nbsp;old music & keep&nbsp;the&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;my catalog consistent with songs I choose to release & believe in,” Wallen wrote. “It’s gross, greedy & an example of how the dark side of the music business can suck the soul out of artists.”</p><p>Wallen ultimately decided to re-record the song “Spin You Around,” releasing it on Thursday night. He also shared that he’s donating $100,000 from the Morgan Wallen Foundation to the Volunteer Lawyers & Professionals For The Arts (VLPA) program.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MORGAN WALLEN APPEARS IN SURPRISE CAMEO IN DRAKE’S ‘YOU BROKE MY HEART’ MUSIC VIDEO</a></strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m writing y’all from a duck hunting trip because I want to fill you in on something happening tonight.</p><p>Back in 2014, I went to Florida to try my hand at making original music & songwriting for the first time.
