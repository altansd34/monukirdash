They’ve influenced the course of history and fostered social and political changes through their groundbreaking theories. They even seeped their way into popular culture through their famous quotes. Even some of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrated French comedians</a> sometimes dab into literature and philosophy. So it would be hard to get a proper sense of French culture without knowing its most significant thinkers.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you start racking your brains, we have gathered a list of seven famous French philosophers throughout the centuries. Here they are, in chronological order according to their years of birth:</p><li><a href=#>Michel de Montaigne</a></li><li><a href=#>René Descartes</a></li><li><a href=#>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a></li><li><a href=#>Auguste Compte</a></li><li><a href=#>Jean-Paul Sartre</a></li><li><a href=#>Simone de Beauvoir</a></li><li><a href=#>Claude Levi-Strauss</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Michel-de-Montaigne>1. Michel de Montaigne</h2><p>1533 – 1592</p><p>One of the most influential writers and philosophers of the French Renaissance, Michel de Montaigne is most famous for his Essais (or Essays in English), a mix of personal anecdotes and philosophical reflections. Taking a more modern approach, the author placed himself at the center of his book, boldly declaring “je suis moi-même la matière de mon livre” (I am the matter of my book). Yet, far from being self-centered, Montaigne is also prone to skepticism, such as when he questioned his own breadth of knowledge by asking “que sais-je ?” (what do I know?).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-René-Descartes>2. René Descartes</h2><p>1596 – 1650</p><p>René Descartes has penned what may well be the most famous French quote of all time: “je pense, donc je suis” (I think, therefore I am). A scholar of mathematics and philosophy, he applied the same deductive mode of reasoning in both areas of study: Starting from a general, abstract proposition, he would work his way to a specific conclusion. His rationalistic approach was so influential that this method of thinking was named after him: cartésianisme<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Jean-Jacques-Rousseau>3. Jean-Jacques Rousseau</h2><p>1712 – 1778</p><p>Though he died in 1778, Jean-Jacques Rousseau is often considered one of the main philosophers to have inspired the French Revolution of 1789 through his writings. In such books as Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique (On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right), this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">philosophe des Lumières</a> developed his political philosophy based on such modern notions as equality, freedom and popular sovereignty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Auguste-Compte>4. Auguste Compte</h2><p>1798 – 1857</p><p>Often considered to be the first philosopher of modern science, Auguste Compte believed that all knowledge stems from scientific observations and conclusions. Born in 1798 towards the end of the French Revolution, he developed a positive philosophy with the intent of resolving social disorder and unrest. He also greatly contributed to the development of sociology, and even gave this brand of science its name.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Jean-Paul-Sartre>5. Jean-Paul Sartre</h2><p>1905 – 1980&nbsp;</p><p>Not content with being one half of the most famous French philosopher couple of modern times alongside Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre was also a political activist, playwright and novelist. He is often considered as the founding father of the French existentialist school of thought, which can be summarized by one of his most famous quotes: “L’existence précède l’essence” (The existence precedes the essence). Simply put, human beings are not predetermined by their own nature or their social and cultural background but are in full control of their own value system, actions and destiny.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Simone-de-Beauvoir>6. Simone de Beauvoir</h2><p>1908 – 1986&nbsp;</p><p>The only woman and the only winner of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prix Goncourt</a> on our list, Simone de Beauvoir didn’t actually consider herself a philosopher. However, her contributions to feminist theory and existentialism are undeniable. In her most famous book, Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex), she argued that “On ne naît pas femme, on le devient” (One is not born, but rather becomes a woman). She believed that the notion of a woman is defined by our societal conventions and attitudes, rather than by a natural state, thus pioneering the distinction between gender and sex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Claude-Levi-Strauss>7. Claude Levi-Strauss</h2><p>1908 – 2009&nbsp;</p><p>Another name among modern French philosophers, Claude Levi-Strauss considered philosophy from the point of view of anthropology. He defended the idea that there was no structural difference between a “civilized mind” and a “savage mind”, as both displayed the same human characteristics. A member of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Académie française</a>, Levi-Strauss is deemed to be a founding father of modern sociology and ethnology.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Think big with some of the most famous French philosophers&nbsp;</h2><p>Alongside food, wine and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fashion</a>, France is famous across the world for its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">literature an</a>d philosophy and it is quite easy to see why by looking at our list of seven French philosophers. Even with such a small panel, the range of topics, methods and applications that these intellectuals have demonstrated is both self-evident and breathtaking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anne-Lise-1.jpg><h2>Anne-Lise Vassoille</h2><p>Anne-Lise is a translator and copywriter working for various industries...
