He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;maintenance guy and has been helping this single mother a&nbsp;lot lately. I&nbsp;don’t mind him helping anyone at&nbsp;all, he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;kind heart and has always helped people, that’s what&nbsp;I love about him. Additionally, they started texting each other late at&nbsp;night. But I&nbsp;checked, and it’s only about <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> stuff.»</p><p>«So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was cool about it&nbsp;up&nbsp;until the other night when&nbsp;I caught a&nbsp;text from her saying she was scared that her ex&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;come around or&nbsp;something. So&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;watch over her house, which ended up&nbsp;causing a&nbsp;fight between&nbsp;us.»</p><p>«Then, the other day, her car was broken, and my&nbsp;husband picked her up&nbsp;and her kids from work and school, and didn’t tell me&nbsp;he&nbsp;was doing this. And lately, I’ve noticed he’s been constantly „forgetting“ tools at&nbsp;her house, and&nbsp;I just have a&nbsp;horrible gut feeling they are either interested in&nbsp;each other or&nbsp;already having an&nbsp;affair at&nbsp;this point.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/738/ffd/be380252e3842452aa90f20158.png><p>«I&nbsp;hate this feeling. He&nbsp;gets so&nbsp;mad when&nbsp;I bring it&nbsp;up, like how dare&nbsp;I stop him from helping this single mother, and he&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;feel bad about&nbsp;it. But it&nbsp;didn’t stop here. The other day, he&nbsp;went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;asking me&nbsp;to&nbsp;babysit her kids while she goes to&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;I definitely refused. I&nbsp;really want nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with this woman, and I’m sick of&nbsp;hearing about her. My&nbsp;husband blew up&nbsp;at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for saying&nbsp;no.»</p><p>«I&nbsp;don’t know what to&nbsp;do. Should I&nbsp;contact her and ask or&nbsp;tell her not to&nbsp;message him so&nbsp;late? I&nbsp;really don’t feel comfortable anymore with the thought of&nbsp;them being just friends. We&nbsp;have kids together, so&nbsp;leaving him isn’t that simple. I’m at&nbsp;a&nbsp;loss, and I’m having a&nbsp;hard time thinking clearly about this without my&nbsp;emotions clouding my&nbsp;thoughts. Any insight would be&nbsp;great.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fd/e20/a7db265ca9ac7104932ce7fdd2.jpg><p><h2>People who read her post joined the conversation, sharing their viewpoints and offering advice.</h2></p><ul><li>I&nbsp;would sit him down and tell him point-blank, «It’s her or&nbsp;me! You either cut off this inappropriate relationship, and we&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;couples counseling, or&nbsp;you can go&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;her house permanently while we&nbsp;get a&nbsp;divorce. I’m not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the second priority in&nbsp;my&nbsp;own marriage.<br>I&nbsp;am your wife, not her. If&nbsp;you want her fine, leave. If&nbsp;you choose&nbsp;me, you will go&nbsp;completely no&nbsp;contact with her from here on&nbsp;out.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;TheLeoScribe&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>He&nbsp;«blew&nbsp;up» on&nbsp;you?! That’s classic gaslighting. He’s using outrage to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;appear that your concerns are baseless and that you’re not in&nbsp;touch with reality. It&nbsp;sounds like he’s already cheating.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Comfortable-Lion-445&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>He&nbsp;prioritizes her more than you, and he’s mad that you’re getting in&nbsp;his way. He’s blowing up&nbsp;at&nbsp;you, his partner, to&nbsp;defend another single woman. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;respects you properly, he&nbsp;would understand why this makes you uncomfortable and make changes, negotiate, and reassure you.<br>But instead, he’s getting angry and defensive. Regardless of&nbsp;if&nbsp;he’s cheating or&nbsp;not, he’s being wildly disrespectful. Please take a&nbsp;step back and look at&nbsp;the pros and cons of&nbsp;your relationship as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole, is&nbsp;it&nbsp;worth it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stuck with a&nbsp;man that is&nbsp;behaving this way? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Valze_Vods&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77c/668/8179cf5fa7a54fca964cf1f28c.jpg><ul><li>It&nbsp;almost doesn’t matter if&nbsp;they’re having an&nbsp;affair or&nbsp;not. She’s openly inserted him into the «substitute husband» role, and he’s happy to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;on. That’s a&nbsp;problem on&nbsp;its own. Nobody should get priority over your life partner who you made vows&nbsp;to. Both your husband and this woman are playing in&nbsp;your face.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;TheSpiral11&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I’d have to&nbsp;say there is&nbsp;at&nbsp;least some attraction. At&nbsp;this point, doing all these extra little things, seems like more than just trying to&nbsp;help someone.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;jpmst17&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>He&nbsp;may have a&nbsp;kind heart for her, but he&nbsp;doesn’t care about your feelings. You said you understand that he&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;help people, but he&nbsp;needs some boundaries as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;affecting your relationship and trust for him. How would he&nbsp;feel if&nbsp;the situation were reversed. If&nbsp;he’s not willing to&nbsp;put your needs first, then&nbsp;I think you do&nbsp;need to&nbsp;reconsider your relationship with him.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Dear_Parsnip_6802&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>In&nbsp;this other <a href=#>post</a>, we&nbsp;explore the emotional journey of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different woman who felt her confidence shatter after her husband admitted something during a&nbsp;therapy session. The confession not only made her rethink their relationship, but also made her question who she is&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6qr%2BMn5ilpJmjtG6yzqtkmqafqbWmvoywpqaZnmK2brDOp6tmo56kxG60zrBkraddqMGwvIyiq2ZwYW2AdIOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
