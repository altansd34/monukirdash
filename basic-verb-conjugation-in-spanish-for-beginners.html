The <a href=#>best way to learn Spanish</a> is by chatting with native Spanish-speakers. In order to chat, you need to know verbs for two reasons.</p><p>First, knowing verbs is helpful. Verbs are action words. Any word with an –AR, -ER, or –IR ending in Spanish is a verb. Seeing a verb in a sentence means something is happening. Second, knowing Spanish verb conjugations helps with comprehension. The verb means something is happening. Recognising the conjugation tells you who is doing the action. This way you know what’s going on. Let’s go. Here are the basic verb conjugations in Spanish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Verb conjugation in English</strong></h2><p>What is a conjugation? It’s simply a variation word of a verb. The conjugation or verb form is a feature of our language to show us who is doing the action. As native English-speakers who learned grammar naturally as a child, we don’t always notice conjugations. Here is a verb conjugated in English below.&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>to talk</strong> (present tense)</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>talk</td></tr><tr><td>you</td><td>talk</td></tr><tr><td>he/she/it&nbsp;</td><td>talks</td></tr><tr><td>we</td><td>talk</td></tr><tr><td>they/you (all)</td><td>talk</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Of the five above, only one conjugation is different from the root word. Notice how “talk” changes to “talks” for the third person singular? He talks. She talks. It talks. We never say “I talks” or “we talks”. Conjugations tell us who is talking (voice), how many people are talking (number), when they are talking (tense), and what they are talking about (mood).</p><p>Imagine you are in a crowded, noisy pub with a gal friend Francisca. She is telling a story but you don’t catch the whole sentence. All you hear is “……talks so loud, I can’t stand it!” Based on the s at the end of the word talks, you know that Francisco (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancha</a>) is gossiping about a third person (not you and not herself). The verb conjugation gave you that information.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guide to basic pronouns in Spanish (DO v IO)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Verb conjugations in Spanish</strong></h2><p>All languages have verb conjugations. As we saw in English, some languages have nearly the same conjugation as the root word. In Spanish verb conjugations, the form changes for every single voice. It’s a bit complicated, but the nice part is how easy it is to spot. Spanish verb conjugations all start with the root word, but only the endings change.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three basic types of verb in Spanish. We call them –AR, -ER, and –IR ending verbs. This is because all root verbs in Spanish end with these letters. These types of regular verbs each have one style of conjugation.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The best YouTube channels for learning Spanish</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>AR verb conjugation in Spanish: Hablar</strong></h3><p>Hablar means to talk in Spanish.
