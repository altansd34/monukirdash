This may make them more vulnerable to&nbsp;doing what others&nbsp;do, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;wrong or&nbsp;risky.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;gathered 10&nbsp;tips that could help parents to&nbsp;guide their children in&nbsp;coping with social pressure. Before continuing, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;remind you that this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;informative article and that you should consult specialists, like educators and psychologists, to&nbsp;help give you better support.</p><p><h2>1. Try to&nbsp;maintain good communication with your children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80d/cb1/1c690857d495f1b9afcc1bf5a2.jpg><p>Maintaining good <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>strengthening</a> your relationship with your children is&nbsp;fundamental to&nbsp;overcoming difficult moments as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable for parents to&nbsp;let them know that they are always willing to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;them and talk about any topic with them. In&nbsp;this way, you will be&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;foundation for them to&nbsp;trust you and feel that they can have conversations about uncomfortable situations, like social pressure.</p><p>To&nbsp;achieve <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>good communication</a>, take turns listening to&nbsp;what each other has to&nbsp;say. At&nbsp;all times avoid aggressiveness, being harsh, not listening, and blaming. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable to&nbsp;ask questions and share your concerns about something, instead of&nbsp;assuming and criticizing.</p><p><h2>2. Meet their friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/72c/acc/998abe5b42add761af48e62fbf.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children’s friends</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this by&nbsp;inviting them into your home, offering them a&nbsp;safe and pleasant space where they can hang out, with appetizing food and good humor. This allows the host parents to&nbsp;establish rules of&nbsp;conduct and, in&nbsp;turn, to&nbsp;better understand what they talk about, what interests them, and what concerns them.</p><p>Another tip is&nbsp;to&nbsp;reach out to&nbsp;the parents in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> group to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;the family values and ways of&nbsp;parenting that they share. In&nbsp;addition, having good relationships with them can help obtain relevant information when the children spend time in&nbsp;other homes or&nbsp;are supervised at&nbsp;different events by&nbsp;other adults, for example: who they will be&nbsp;with, who will take care of&nbsp;them, what time they will arrive.</p><p><h2>3. Encourage them to&nbsp;meet new people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a60/0a7/c4f97a51ec80b3b9af10c4951a.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the reasons why they may give in&nbsp;to&nbsp;social pressure is&nbsp;that they want to&nbsp;have friends, be&nbsp;accepted, and belong to&nbsp;a&nbsp;group that gives them security. If&nbsp;parents encourage and support their children to&nbsp;practice various activities where they can meet new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>peers</a>, they will have the opportunity to&nbsp;cultivate friendships in&nbsp;different environments and avoid wanting to&nbsp;fit into just one.</p><p><h2>4. Teach them to&nbsp;reflect on&nbsp;the consequences of&nbsp;unsafe behaviors.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/343/4af/5df3c4500e9b7efe2542f64e72.jpg><p>To&nbsp;help kids make safer decisions, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;teaching them what behaviors are wrong or&nbsp;risky, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable that they be&nbsp;prompted to&nbsp;reflect on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consequences</a> of&nbsp;what their actions might cause to&nbsp;themselves and others. These ideas may help:</p><ul><li>If&nbsp;they participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;harm another child, the child could get hurt and feel sad. You might ask them something like: Can you think about how you would feel if&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;their place?</li><li>If&nbsp;they break rules or&nbsp;misbehave at&nbsp;school, tell them they could be&nbsp;expelled, lose privileges at&nbsp;home (such as&nbsp;field trips or&nbsp;playtime), and that it&nbsp;could affect their grades.</li><li>If&nbsp;they think it’s a&nbsp;joke to&nbsp;steal something from a&nbsp;store and is&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;their friends, it’s important for them to&nbsp;know that this could have legal consequences and that it’s not a&nbsp;game.</li><li>Before they do&nbsp;something they are unsure about doing, they might ask themselves: Will this make me&nbsp;feel proud of&nbsp;myself afterward?</li></ul><p><h2>5. Come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;“safe” word in&nbsp;case they need help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/160/564/f1adc354ffb080ca800c5a9597.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;practice that can get youngsters out of&nbsp;trouble when they feel uncomfortable or&nbsp;fearful in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Special</a> code words or&nbsp;phrases will allow them to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;call or&nbsp;send a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;tell their parents to&nbsp;come looking for them, without telling their friends the real reason, because they may be&nbsp;embarrassed or&nbsp;ashamed.</p><p>For example, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager is&nbsp;at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party and feels uncomfortable, they can call their parents or&nbsp;send them a&nbsp;message with the phrase they agreed on&nbsp;before for those situations, like, “Mom, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;bad headache, can you look for&nbsp;me?” That way, without asking any more questions, the mother will know she needs your help.</p><p><h2>6. Let them know it’s okay to&nbsp;say “no” sometimes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef4/4df/fe77e55628b68ead20cc593948.jpg><p>Even for adults, it&nbsp;can sometimes be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;say “no.” That’s why it’s important for parents to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;how they set limits or&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;do&nbsp;certain things. Modeling by&nbsp;example is&nbsp;key&nbsp;— in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;reassuring them that it’s okay to&nbsp;say “no,” it’s great if&nbsp;they can also see how their family members set limits respectfully and clearly by&nbsp;saying, “No, that’s not okay for&nbsp;me” or&nbsp;“I&nbsp;can’t right now.”</p><p>Being alone in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;group and having to&nbsp;say no&nbsp;can be&nbsp;overwhelming at&nbsp;times for them, If&nbsp;they have friends with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>similar</a> values perhaps they can find some support so&nbsp;that together they can refuse to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the wrong thing without fear of&nbsp;ridicule.</p><p><h2>7. Teach them other strategies to&nbsp;respond if&nbsp;they can’t say “no” directly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/947/012/6f5e6658e3925d6cd0faee57fc.jpg><p>Sometimes they may not want to&nbsp;say no&nbsp;outright, so&nbsp;parents can give their children other strategies. They may tell them to&nbsp;place “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blame</a>” on&nbsp;them for refusing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something they think is&nbsp;wrong or&nbsp;dangerous. One argument they might use is&nbsp;this or&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar one: “Are you kidding? My&nbsp;parents will ground me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;month if&nbsp;I&nbsp;do that.”</p><p>Another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>alternative</a> is&nbsp;to&nbsp;propose to&nbsp;their classmates to&nbsp;do&nbsp;another activity that is&nbsp;more fun or&nbsp;interesting than the incorrect behavior their friends are proposing at&nbsp;that moment.</p><p><h2>8. Practice role-playing so&nbsp;that they learn how to&nbsp;handle a&nbsp;proposal they want to&nbsp;reject.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c11/3ae/ee5ac058978be4428525752298.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;giving them ideas for how they can respond to&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where they are pressured, parents can suggest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role-playing</a> (as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were a&nbsp;rehearsal for a&nbsp;play or&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene from a&nbsp;favorite series). This practice can help parents teach children how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respectful and firm when they disagree with something.</p><p>For example, if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;child who has been exposed to&nbsp;teasing at&nbsp;school, parents can ask the child to&nbsp;play with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friend</a> who is&nbsp;teasing them and the child will expose a&nbsp;situation similar to&nbsp;what they are going through. Then, the adult has the opportunity to&nbsp;suggest an&nbsp;appropriate phrase, that is&nbsp;both respectful and witty, to&nbsp;use to&nbsp;respond by&nbsp;playing the role of&nbsp;the child.</p><p><h2>9. Limit and monitor the time they spend online.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84d/112/26b01a552c836fe09d8f74f60e.jpg><p>Nowadays, the digital environment is&nbsp;a&nbsp;medium where children and adolescents can be&nbsp;exposed to&nbsp;social pressure, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable for parents and caregivers to&nbsp;set <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>limits</a> considering the age of&nbsp;their children. Here are some tips that could be&nbsp;useful:</p><ul><li>Limit the time they spend on&nbsp;the Internet, distributed in&nbsp;balance with other activities like homework, family time, and extracurricular activities.</li><li>Monitor the content they consume: check the ratings of&nbsp;TV or&nbsp;streaming shows, movies, and video games that they watch. You can also review their internet search history and view the apps they have on&nbsp;their phone.</li><li>Parents can make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;habit to&nbsp;watch movies and series as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family, and surf the internet together. This way they can analyze what they watch and reinforce family values.</li><li>Ask them which celebrities or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>influencers</a> they admire and inquire about the aspects they value about them, to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;something specific that should be&nbsp;explained to&nbsp;them about the difference between what the person shows on&nbsp;their social networks and the other side that is&nbsp;not being published.</li><li>Be&nbsp;informed about issues like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cyberbullying</a> and explain to&nbsp;adolescent children about the practices that can harm them when they are online.</li></ul><p><h2>10. Help them develop a&nbsp;healthy dose of&nbsp;self-esteem.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2d/d05/99ff805cca86d24b5407462b26.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;very important for parents to&nbsp;help their children have healthy self-esteem and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>self-confidence</a> because this makes them less likely to&nbsp;give in&nbsp;to&nbsp;pressure from others. Respecting their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>preferences</a>, praising their achievements and good behaviors, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;showing them that you trust them and that they can make good decisions are some aspects that could contribute in&nbsp;this sense.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these tips would you like to&nbsp;start implementing in&nbsp;your family? Can you share any other tips with the parents reading this for how they can teach their children how to&nbsp;deal with peer pressure?</p><p>Got some cool photos or&nbsp;stories and want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;featured on&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>?
