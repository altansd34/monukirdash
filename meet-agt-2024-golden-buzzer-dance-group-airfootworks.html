On Tuesday night, America saw Golden Buzzer recipients Sky Elements, Schumacher, and Legion, alongside other popular acts like Alex Sampson, Biko’s Manna, and more. In case you missed it, AirFootWorks earned Howie Mandel’s Golden Buzzer.</strong></p><p>Following last week’s first ever AGT live show golden buzzer, the show returned with another. The episode began with Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer group <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legion</a>, followed by Young-Min, Alex Sampson, and more.</p><p>Following a backstory about how AirFootWorks began, the group took the stage. This time, the group returned to the stage with a multi-media version of their defying gravity dance routine. After the act, Simon Cowell broke the rules again and hit the Golden Buzzer for them, WHILE Howie Mandel was reaching for the same buzzer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In case you missed it, Airfootworks is a Japanese dance group that uses their upper body strength to dance in the air. According to Airfootworks’ website, World Order choreographer and performer Takashi Jonishi spent his time performing in shows around the world.</p><p>Takashi Jonishi then created a new form of dance, named AIRDANCE. The performances, on a iron bar, “does not make you feel gravity as if you were walking in the air.” This dance type “is the one and only thing that draws the person who sees into the world view.”</p><p>Airfootworks is a “one of a kind dance that gives people watching it the impression of weightlessness, as if the performer is walking in mid-air.” According to the groups’ website, members include Takashi Jonishi, Ryo Honta, Noa Uochi, Kou Koga, and Keita Naganuma.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-reacts-to-simon-cowell-stealing-his-golden-buzzer>Howie Mandel Reacts to Simon Cowell Stealing His Golden Buzzer</h2><p>This is the first time we’ve ever seen the Golden Buzzer on the live shows, and the first time we’ve seen a the buzzer stolen in the live shows. Everyone was shocked by this moment, even host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a>! After a commercial break, the show provided a replay of the judges hitting the golden buzzer together.</p><p>“He tried to steal the night… Yeah I don’t know, it was supposed to be me and yet.. he just…that’s how good they were,” Howie Mandel said to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">THE BUZZ</a>. “I think he was so overwhelmed by the magnificent of magnificence of that act that he forgot all the rules and threw rules by the waist side and just went for it, that’s how good they were.”</p><p>Ironically this isn’t the first time Cowell has stolen one of Mandel’s Golden Buzzers. In 2020 a similar moment happened on Season 2 of AGT: The Champions. In that moment it was Mandel’s week to give the Golden Buzzer, but Cowell took it and gave it to dance group Boogie Storm.</p><p>America’s Got Talent returns to NBC on Wednesday, August 21 for this week’s results show. The next set of live performances is Tuesday, August 27. The next episode will either be Heidi Klum or Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer week.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Original_Airfootworks_Trae-Patton_NBC-1-220x147.jpg alt="Simon Cowell Tries to Steal Howie Mandel’s Golden Buzzer as ‘AGT’ Live Shows Continue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>golden buzzer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRnMFufo9ra2afn6GxprqMm6yzspWneqWtzZycZp%2BipMKxecCiqZ%2Bnn6nEsL7KrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
