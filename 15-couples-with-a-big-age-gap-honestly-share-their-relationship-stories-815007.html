My&nbsp;mum had me&nbsp;when she was&nbsp;30, and my&nbsp;dad was in&nbsp;his mid-50s. My&nbsp;dad always looked after himself and kept himself fit, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;mum always said she never really felt the age difference in&nbsp;the early years, but he&nbsp;started showing signs of&nbsp;Parkinson’s disease when&nbsp;I was about&nbsp;5, and&nbsp;I can only really remember him needing my&nbsp;mum to&nbsp;care for him increasingly until it&nbsp;claimed his life when he&nbsp;was 75. My&nbsp;mum has said to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;recent years when discussing&nbsp;it, that she loved my&nbsp;dad dearly, but she recognizes that the age difference cost them a&nbsp;lot since she spent more years in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;caretaker than she did as&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner. That said, with a&nbsp;little bad luck, this could happen at&nbsp;any age, and, of&nbsp;course, we&nbsp;loved him and wouldn’t give up&nbsp;that time with him.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;HexonBogon&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>One of&nbsp;my&nbsp;exes was 25&nbsp;years older than&nbsp;me, and another one was 26&nbsp;years older.

Oh, 15.” Or&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone brings up&nbsp;a&nbsp;historical figure in&nbsp;the conversation, one of&nbsp;them quietly says to&nbsp;the other, “I&nbsp;knew him, remember?” And they begin to&nbsp;talk softly to&nbsp;each other.

But he&nbsp;would fuss if&nbsp;I didn’t wear a&nbsp;hat, remind me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take lunch to&nbsp;work, and buy me&nbsp;sweets, ice cream, or&nbsp;flowers every night.
