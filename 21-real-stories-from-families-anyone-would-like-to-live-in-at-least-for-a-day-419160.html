She asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;looking for him. I&nbsp;said, “Alright, alright, I&nbsp;will” while looking at&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandfather who was at&nbsp;my&nbsp;place making a&nbsp;portrait for my&nbsp;grandma. Their <a href=# title=anniversary data-link=tag>anniversary</a> was next Thursday.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/340/60a/ac85fb50c88831ea4ffb8d1c1b.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>“My&nbsp;84-year-old grandmother apologized for having to&nbsp;wear her nightgown in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;said it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;problem and that it&nbsp;actually looked very comfortable, so&nbsp;she immediately offered one to&nbsp;me. It’s not like&nbsp;I could have rejected this generous gift...”</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;14-year old daughter. She is&nbsp;dating a&nbsp;boy who is&nbsp;14, too. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;very well-mannered, a&nbsp;nice guy. Every Sunday, he&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;our place... and my&nbsp;daughter and he&nbsp;spend the entire day in&nbsp;her room. I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;disturb them, but one Sunday I&nbsp;thought: “We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;the 21st century. Kids are growing faster nowadays. What if&nbsp;they are making their own kids there?!” So&nbsp;I&nbsp;ran to&nbsp;her room, I&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;the door, the lamp was dimmed, I&nbsp;heard them talking. I&nbsp;come into the room looking like “I&nbsp;got you,” and you know what I&nbsp;see? My&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;sitting in&nbsp;the armchair knitting a&nbsp;scarf and the boy is&nbsp;lying on&nbsp;the couch and reading out loud. The only thing&nbsp;I could say was: “Would you like some <a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a>?..”</li><li>I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the store to&nbsp;get some winter boots for myself. Right next to&nbsp;me&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;father with a&nbsp;small son trying on&nbsp;shoes.</li></ul><p>Dad: “You like these ones, right? Are they comfortable enough?”</p><p>Son: “Yeah, they are awesome”.</p><p>Father, helping to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;the second shoe: “The price seems right, we’ll take these”.</p><p>Son, shocked: “What? That’s it? Is&nbsp;this the last store we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;visit? Daaad, can&nbsp;I please go&nbsp;shopping only with you from now&nbsp;on?”</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;courier in&nbsp;an&nbsp;online store. It’s a&nbsp;good job, there are many clients, but it’s not the point here.</li></ul><p>My&nbsp;daughter had a&nbsp;lesson in&nbsp;the kindergarten, where every kid was asked what their parents did for a&nbsp;living. And my&nbsp;daughter answered happily: “My&nbsp;father gives people some bags. People are happy to&nbsp;get the bags and they pay him for that.</p><p>P.S. The teachers from the kindergarten decided to&nbsp;find out what these “bags of&nbsp;happiness” were that I&nbsp;sold.</p><p><h2>"I might need to have a talk with my daughter, but I'm not sure what I'd even say."</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/144/806/81d8345d69930966d04ddb69f9.jpg><ul><li>This year, schools made wearing uniforms obligatory, and girls needed to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;black dress with an&nbsp;apron. My&nbsp;parents and&nbsp;I were having a&nbsp;<a href=# title=vacation data-link=tag>vacation</a> when it&nbsp;happened, and when we&nbsp;returned, all the dresses were already bought. So, now I’m wearing a&nbsp;uniform from a&nbsp;sex-shop.</li><li>When my&nbsp;wife was pregnant, she woke me&nbsp;up&nbsp;once in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the night to&nbsp;take her to&nbsp;smell rails.

He&nbsp;didn’t speak and used only gestures to&nbsp;communicate with&nbsp;us. Doctors didn’t know the reason because all the tests they conducted showed that he&nbsp;was perfectly fine. Anyway, he&nbsp;started talking later, and his first words were: “GET OFF”.</p></li><li>My&nbsp;father stole a&nbsp;bar of&nbsp;<a href=# title=soap data-link=tag>soap</a> from the toilet in&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a> saying: “This place has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;useful at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;this way.”</li></ul><p><h2>"Okay, so my dad just bought a selfie stick and this is the first thing he sends me."</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/333/c57/514a1655eca6e39864854d26a3.png><ul><li>I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;you know, but after a&nbsp;woman gets pregnant, she needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;checked not only by&nbsp;her gynecologist but also by&nbsp;other specialists. So, after&nbsp;I completed this task, I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;all the conclusions from other doctors. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I were having dinner with my&nbsp;parents and he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;results:</li></ul><p>—&nbsp;So, are you alright?</p><p>—&nbsp;The eye doctor said that&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;lazy eye, and the otolaryngologist concluded that my&nbsp;nose is&nbsp;crooked. And of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;have scoliosis.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband, shocked:</p><p>—&nbsp;Why didn’t you tell me&nbsp;before the wedding?</p><p>My&nbsp;mum reacted:</p><p>—&nbsp;When she was living with&nbsp;us, she was okay. I&nbsp;guess, it&nbsp;happened after the wedding.</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;wife got sick. She had a&nbsp;very bad fever, so&nbsp;bad, in&nbsp;fact, that she could barely speak. My&nbsp;four-year-old daughter hadn’t seen her parents sick before. So, she tried to&nbsp;get her mother up&nbsp;and failed.</li></ul><p>She comes up&nbsp;to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and says:</p><p>—&nbsp;Daddy, I’ve found out that she is&nbsp;not pretending.

In&nbsp;my&nbsp;childhood, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the kindergarten. I&nbsp;remember it&nbsp;was Monday and&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;there. She told me&nbsp;that if&nbsp;I would go&nbsp;there for just 5&nbsp;days, she would give me&nbsp;2&nbsp;ENTIRE DAYS OFF. I&nbsp;was happy that&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;good deal and went to&nbsp;the kindergarten.</li><li>My&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;four years old. I&nbsp;was picking her up&nbsp;from the kindergarten.</li></ul><p>—&nbsp;Daddy, we&nbsp;played princesses today. I&nbsp;was Elsa.</p><p>I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;joke:</p><p>—&nbsp;Is&nbsp;that the one with red hair and her mother is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bear?</p><p>—&nbsp;NO!</p><p>—&nbsp;The one who lived with a&nbsp;monster in&nbsp;a&nbsp;castle?</p><p>—&nbsp;NO!</p><p>She put her hands on&nbsp;her hips and said angrily:</p><p>—&nbsp;That’s it, dad! When we&nbsp;come home today, we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;learn all about princesses!</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;father raised me&nbsp;like a&nbsp;real man! I&nbsp;can fix the washing machine, I&nbsp;can put something on&nbsp;the wall, I&nbsp;can repair a&nbsp;car. I&nbsp;have my&nbsp;own toolbox. I&nbsp;help the weak and the needy. The only problem is&nbsp;that my&nbsp;husband doesn’t like&nbsp;it... After all, I’m also a&nbsp;mother and a&nbsp;wife.</li><li>My&nbsp;husband talks in&nbsp;his sleep from time to&nbsp;time. When I&nbsp;ask him something, he&nbsp;usually talks nonsense. So, I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;great to&nbsp;have some fun. I&nbsp;asked some questions like “Honey, do&nbsp;you love&nbsp;me?” and&nbsp;I received “Yes, I&nbsp;love you”.</li></ul><p>So, next time, we&nbsp;had this conversation:</p><p>—&nbsp;John, who do&nbsp;you love?</p><p>—&nbsp;Plastic.</p><p>—&nbsp;What plastic?</p><p>—&nbsp;Extruded polystyrene.</p><p>P.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;what happens to&nbsp;someone who has been doing refurbishments for far too long.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;fake mustache in&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s car. She said calmly that she puts it&nbsp;on&nbsp;when driving sometimes. God, I&nbsp;have such a&nbsp;boring life!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49f/ef1/aeec085359a18e1c56d70c0e70.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;pregnant belly helped me&nbsp;this Halloween. I&nbsp;present to&nbsp;you: Nacho Libre Maternity Wear.”</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;fiance (now my&nbsp;husband) on&nbsp;our wedding day wrote this on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sky lantern: “Take her away. It’s the first time I’ve seen her”.</li><li>I&nbsp;am not a&nbsp;squeamish person. Sometimes, when&nbsp;I would drop something on&nbsp;the floor, I’d just blow on&nbsp;it, and I’d put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mouth. When I&nbsp;had kids, I&nbsp;learned to&nbsp;control myself, but&nbsp;I remember one time when we&nbsp;were sitting in&nbsp;the kitchen and eating a&nbsp;pie. My&nbsp;daughter drops a&nbsp;piece on&nbsp;the floor and my&nbsp;wife wants to&nbsp;pick it&nbsp;up. But my&nbsp;daughter shouts: “Mom, don’t touch&nbsp;it! It’s Dad’s piece now!”</li><li>We&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;second child, and instead, we&nbsp;had twins. It&nbsp;was very hard with them. They used to&nbsp;scream all day, and especially at&nbsp;nights. Look, it&nbsp;was EXTREMELY difficult. So, one night we&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;put them to&nbsp;sleep. My&nbsp;husband went to&nbsp;the bathroom and&nbsp;I felt thirsty. I&nbsp;was sitting quietly in&nbsp;the kitchen. He&nbsp;walks out of&nbsp;the bathroom and doesn’t see me&nbsp;with the kids. He&nbsp;checks the other room&nbsp;— I’m not there. He&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the kitchen and doesn’t see me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the dark, goes back to&nbsp;the bathroom, and I’m not there either. He&nbsp;started running around the apartment, and finally, he&nbsp;rushes into the kitchen, turns the light on&nbsp;and says: "I&nbsp;thought you ran away! I&nbsp;was really scared. But, honestly, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea...</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/853/d9b/e5d0c5536bb7747999f7722ed9.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>“One benefit of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;little person is&nbsp;you can drive your daughter around in&nbsp;her Barbie Jeep when she’s had too much to&nbsp;drink...”</p><ul><li>I’m on&nbsp;a&nbsp;maternity leave and my&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;working constantly. He&nbsp;wakes up&nbsp;very early, and when he&nbsp;comes back, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;usually exhausted. Normally, we&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;together and&nbsp;I make breakfast. When I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;this morning, I&nbsp;didn’t see my&nbsp;husband. I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;the clock&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was 10&nbsp;AM already. I&nbsp;was mad at&nbsp;myself that&nbsp;I overslept and didn’t cook for him. I&nbsp;come into the kitchen: the dishes are done, everything is&nbsp;tidy, the table is&nbsp;clean. A&nbsp;bouquet of&nbsp;flowers is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the table with my&nbsp;favorite biscuits and a&nbsp;little note: “Your job being a&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;way more important than mine. Love you”. I&nbsp;almost cried.</li><li>In&nbsp;my&nbsp;childhood, my&nbsp;father always picked me&nbsp;up&nbsp;from kindergarten. But I&nbsp;will never forget the day when a&nbsp;man&nbsp;I didn’t know came for&nbsp;me, and the teacher said he&nbsp;was my&nbsp;dad. But it&nbsp;wasn’t him! I&nbsp;cried and begged them not to&nbsp;let him take&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;cried until he&nbsp;took me&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother’s apartment. I&nbsp;couldn’t recognize my&nbsp;dad without the mustache and the beard for a&nbsp;long time...</li></ul><p>Of&nbsp;course, all families are unique, and we&nbsp;are sure that every family has their own moving memories about some cute or&nbsp;funny situations.
