Nici also alleges that Beckham even paid for another prostitute to join in on one of those occasions.The father of three has slammed these claims as ‘completely fantasy’, and is reportedly seeking £5 million in damages as well as wanting to sue magazine publisher, Bauer, for allowing to story to be printed in their publication. He has received full support from his wife.Have your say: The TellYouGov keyword for this topic is <a href=#>'David Beckham'</a><a href=#>What is TellYouGov?</a><br><a href=#>What do the numbers on the TellYouGov leaderboard mean?</a><br><a href=#>See the LIVE TellYouGov leaderboard</a></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYGWBbr%2FCqKmeq12owrG8zqur</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
