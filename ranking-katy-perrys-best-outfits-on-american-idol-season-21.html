The singer has clearly been meticulous when it comes to her getups, making her the fashion icon that she is.</strong></p><p>We compiled and ranked some of the pop singer’s best outfits during season 21 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol.</a> If you want to see how Perry slayed each of her fashion ensemble, then keep scrolling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ranking Katy Perry’s American Idol Season 21 Outfits</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. Plaid Slit Dress</h3><p>The plaid slit dress was one of Perry’s outfits back when the show was taping its auditions. This almost casual fit consists of different colors of plaid, made sleek by semi-large slit in the bottom. She paired this with a silver chain necklace and foxy eye makeup to complete the look.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Beaded Halter Dress</h3><p>Also one of her audition outfits, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry</a> looked beautiful in a black halter dress with blue beads on the chest part. The singer matched the same with a pair of blue long boots. Amazingly, her smokey eye makeup was perfect for the ensemble, especially that the bottom of her eyes was also lined blue.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Dark Denim Gown</h3><p>The night of the Top 12 prompted Perry to wear a dark denim gown. Such outfit is definitely well-thought of, from its velvet details to mesh texture. The flowy gown was complimented by the singer’s red lip and brown-toned eye shadow.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Crocodile Skin Halter Gown</h3><p>During what Perry called to be the “judges song contest” night, she wore a turtle halter gown. This bodycon dress appears to have the texture of a crocodile skin, thus improving the usual black dress vibe.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Lavender Leather Suit Terno</h3><p>During <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Week</a>, Perry wore a shiny lavender suit terno and a pair of pointed heels. Her hair at the time was styled in half-pony, giving her a clean but snatched vibe. Finalizing her monochrome look was her shimmery eyeshadow of the same shade of lavender.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Fuchsia Flower Top</h3><p>Another of Perry’s audition getups was her fuchsia flower top matched with sequin-filled bottoms. With her black straight hair and sophisticated makeup, such ensemble was easily one of Perry’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Idol outfits</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Shimmery Black Long Sleeve Gown</h3><p>Perry might be stressed in choosing the last 12 of the show’s Top 24, but that mood is covered by her shimmery black gown. This outfit was made a bit daring due to its hole on the chest part. Such long sleeve gown is certainly Perry’s effortless way to present her chic fashion sense to Idol fans.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Sparkly Spaghetti Strap Gown</h3><p>A black gown is indeed a classic choice for every woman in doubt. During one of the live shows, Perry wore a spaghetti strap gown which was a bit see-through at the bottom. The black bodycon was upgraded in style with beads of different colors, making it extra sparkly foe the night.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Shiny Green Tube Bodycon Gown</h3><p>Amid Top 20 reveal, Perry went with a shiny light green bodycon gown. The singer accessorized this outfit with a pair of silver dangling earrings and several rings. Furthermore, what made this outfit interesting was her hairstyle as she went for a choppy short fringe and a simple bun.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-yellow-green-two-piece-hawaiian-bodycon>1. Yellow Green Two-Piece Hawaiian Bodycon</h3><p>None of Perry’s season 21 outfit can top her two-piece Hawaiian gown. The yellow green bodycon has perfectly accentuated the singer’s curves. Perry elevated this outfit by wearing a pair of chain earrings and styling her hair into a bun.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_DCoreyJohnson_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Best Singing Auditions on AGT 2023 So Far" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHqsrdOyZKmdoqfGtHnBnqqtZZ%2Bqwae106xkqKZdlrqmvsicmKdlmZm8rXnSnpisp55if3J7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
