In a recent podcast interview, Thompson revealed that they actually fight a lot.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-noah-thompson-huntergirl-fight-all-the-time>Noah Thompson, HunterGirl ‘Fight All the Time’</h2><p>“We fight so much,” Thompson told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Life</a> podcast. “Like, honest to God, we do. We’re just like brother and sister, man. It’s kinda bad, though.”</p><p>He went on to explain that he and HunterGirl became friends during their time on the show when their trailers were put together, and they were “up each other’s butt the whole time, for a month and a half straight.”</p><p>The two singers became close, but they “would fight over the stupid stuff.” Thompson recalled, “Like if the trailer was too cold, she would flip out, and I thought it was too hot. And then we would frickin’ fight over that. Just all kinds of crap.”</p><p>The disagreements continued as the two of them went on tour together, with Thompson calling it “the same ordeal.” He added, “But I love her to death, though, man. Hunter’s like my sister.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’S NOAH THOMPSON, HUNTERGIRL RELEASE FIRST SONG TOGETHER</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH7tIfXvx6w</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-thompson-confirms-breakup-with-angel-dixon>Thompson Confirms Breakup with Angel Dixon</h2><p>During his interview with Hollywood Life, Thompson also seemed to confirm what fans had already suspected — that he and his girlfriend Angel Dixon have broken up. The pair <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shares a son</a> named Walker.</p><p>Thompson shared the meaning behind his song “Middle of God Knows Where,” explaining, “That’s a song that I wrote not long after I got off the show, really. And it was about a time I was going through. You know, a breakup, obviously.”</p><p>The singer said the title was an idea from co-writer Allison Veltz, and he shared that the song’s lyrics connected with what he was going through at the time. He and Dixon seem to be on pretty good terms now, as she recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video</a> of 2-year-old Walker dancing at one of his dad’s concerts.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_CynthiaErvio_ArianaGrande-1-220x147.jpg alt="‘Wicked’ Movies Pause Filming Due to SAG-AFTRA Strike" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlnqSuqXnToaamqKOku2601KernqqXnr%2BtecWinqGsXaG2rLGMm6morJiav26tzZ1krKGjqbKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
