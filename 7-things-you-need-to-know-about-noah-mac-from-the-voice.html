He broke records in the competition and has gone on to release an album since the series.</strong></p><p>Mac stunned the audience with every cover song he performed on The Voice. He went on to become a self-taught teen heartthrob and was bound for great things. Here’s 7 things you need to know about Noah Mac.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-his-sister-is-his-biggest-inspiration>1. His Sister is His Biggest Inspiration</h2><p>Mac has shared that his late sister is his biggest music inspiration. She died from cancer at 19 years old. Mac was only seven years old at the time of her passing when he sang her favorite song “Judy and the Dream of Horses” by Belle and Sebastian at her funeral. It was this performance that ignited the singer’s passion of music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-he-started-music-very-young>2. He Started Music Very Young</h2><p>Mac grew up in a musical family full of artists. He’s shared that their holidays were spent singing and playing instruments. After his sister’s funeral he began performing in musical theater. His love of the theater was soon met with the lead in each performance.</p><p>At the time, he began to teach himself to play any instrument, including an old piano in his mother’s art studio. At 15 years old he began writing and producing his own music. He took over an old shed in his backyard and gave it the new purpose as his music studio. He also created his first music video at 15 years old. Mac wrote, produced, and released his own EP at only 17 years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-he-s-an-independent-artist>3. He’s an Independent Artist</h2><p>After The Voice, he took time to discover himself as an artist. At 18 years old he produced and released eight singles that represented him musically. The music was inspired by his growth and transition during that time. His debut album, Pretty Boy was created in his home studio. Everything about this release was done independently. He has shared that this album was the first time he fully identified with his music.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-during-his-time-of-the-voice-he-broke-records>4. During His Time of The Voice He Broke Records</h2><p>This singer left The Voice as one of the most popular on social media. America loved him on the series so much that they followed him on social media. His performances that were released to streaming in the live rounds did exceptionally well on the iTunes charts. His most successful performance of “River” peaked at No. 8 on the chart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-he-enjoyed-switching-coaches-on-the-voice>5. He Enjoyed Switching Coaches on The Voice</h2><p>Mac turned two chairs in his audition for The Voice. His voice turned the chairs of Jennifer Hudson and Blake Shelton. After the audition, Mac joined Team Blake, but would later join Team Jennifer. The singer lost the head-to-head competition against Keisha Renee in the battle rounds. Instead of facing elimination, he was stolen by Hudson. Even though he didn’t in the series, he was thankful for his time on Team Jennifer.</p><p>“When I was on Team Blake he had a different style than me, it was a country team and I don’t think he knew me as an artist as well as J-Hud did,” he <a href=#>said</a>. “When I went to J-Hud she had a better understanding of who I was, she really accepted that and used that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-he-premiered-a-new-look-in-2021>6. He Premiered a New Look in 2021</h2><p>The Voice fans knew Mac for his voluptuous hair on the series, but he had a different look in 2021. Last year, Mac premiered a buzz cut in a YouTube cover video. It seems like the singer no longer is rocking this style in 2022 due to a recent <a href=#>Instagram post</a>. In the recent post his hair is longer than the buzz, but is nowhere near the length from The Voice.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Evvie-Feature.jpg alt="From Faith to Fame: Evvie McKinney’s Journey to ‘The Four’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lmaroaGenMBuxc6uZKedlZl6tbuMpKWor12Wr7DB02alqJmYYrqir4yfqailXam1pnnVqKCcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
