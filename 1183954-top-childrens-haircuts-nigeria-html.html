So check out our picks, show them to your child/their hairdresser, and maybe your kid will finally have the haircut he/she always wanted.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt26evim4mdseg.jpg><h2>Kids’ hair styles for boys</h2><p class=align-left>There are plenty of different boys’ haircuts out there, but a lot of boys kind of want to look the same nowadays. That said, while many of these hairstyles look quite similar, some minor additions could make each hairstyle look one-of-a-kind. Here, we present to you our top 10 stylish haircuts for boys.</p><h3>Skin fade with design</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7mtm2pttu3a.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the most popular men’s hairstyles of this decade is the fade, which comes in all kinds of shapes and forms. In this case, the skin fade is adorned with an interesting design at the temple and combined with some short natural curls at the top. With a haircut like this, your child will look cool and feel very comfortable, as the hair will not get in the eyes or ears.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rock these amazing short hairstyles for black women in 2019</span></p></a><h3>Temple fade with afro</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png><p class=align-left>If you do not want to cut your child’s hair as short as in the previous photo, you can always go for a temple fade and a natural afro on top. As long as your kid’s hair is properly moisturised, taking care of a slightly longer hairstyle should not be an issue.</p><h3>High fade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1dm8kr5p0vpg.jpg><p class=align-left>Returning to extremely short hairstyles, here is a high fade. This kids’ hairstyle will leave your child feeling fresh for weeks, as most of the hair is cut very closely to the head, leaving only a little bit on top. Over time, this will turn into a regular fade.</p><h3>Low fade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4psosu2qf9h.jpg><p class=align-left>High fade might not be for all, particularly if your child is rather self-conscious of their head shape or any other prominent features that might be exposed. For those cases, there is always a low fade, which is just as trendy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/700edfeb48018fd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best high fade haircuts for men to try in 2019</span></p></a><h3>Retro high top</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1h04ogppvvg8.jpg><p class=align-left>This haircut was all the rage in the 80s, and, as you know, fashion tends to come back every once in a while, skipping a generation or two. So if you have not been able to rock this ‘do in your childhood, why not offer this to your child as an alternative to a regular fade? If they do not agree, there is always the good old bald cut.</p><h3>Short dreads</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/700edfeb48018fd5.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Best natural hairstyles for kids</p><p class=align-left>When children are quite little, and they do not have all that much hair, it is a good idea to experiment with it while it is still somewhat manageable. If you want your kid to grow their hair out in one of the simplest and most convenient ways, dreadlocks, or rather faux dreadlocks, should do the trick.</p><h3>Twisted curls with a blowout fade</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2f838hofmsi.jpg><p class=align-left>In our opinion, if your child wants a fade, it is never a bad idea to leave some hair at the top of the head. You can do whatever you want with it: twist it, braid it, make dreads, you name it. Such a haircut will be a joy for both you and your kid.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/00e28877f820fd85.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool skin fade haircuts for guys of all ages</span></p></a><h3>Twisted sponge</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5j6a32l52fl.jpg><p class=align-left>Curvy lines and zigzag shapes shaved on temples and foreheads are all the rage these days, so as long as you have a good barber, this type of hairstyle should turn out great. The importance of a good barber in cases like this one cannot be understated, as one wrong move and the whole haircut could be ruined.</p><h3>Braids</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytcftjnl1aiu8.jpg><p class=align-left>This hairstyle brings back so many memories, and if you grew up with the same pop culture references as we did, it should take you down the memory lane as well. So if you want your child to grow up knowing about the 90s style, you should offer them to try out this haircut.</p><h3>Big ol’ afro</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/00e28877f820fd85.jpg><p class=align-left>Sometimes you just have to let it grow and hope that your comb will not get lost in those luscious locks. If your child feels like wearing their hair long and curly, you should let them, at least for a while, until it turns into a real hassle for all parties involved.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1dc777b925d5cd3b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top-15 amazing mohawk fade haircuts for stylish guys</span></p></a><h2>Kids’ hairstyles for girls</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytm96ncar4lsk.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top Nigerian children hairstyles in 2018</p><p class=align-left>Now, when it comes to finding a good haircut for girls, one can go crazy because of the abundance of options.
