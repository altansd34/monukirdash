Tomorrow, the highly anticipated Battle Rounds begin, after a recap of tonight’s episode (from 8 to 9 p.m. ET). Here’s everything you missed in the new episode.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-four-chair-turn-singer-s-daughter-picks-his-coach>Four-Chair Turn Singer’s Daughter Picks His Coach</h2><p>The episode began with former metal singer, Huntley. The singer managed to turn four chairs before the song’s chorus even hit in his rendition of “She Talks to Angels” by The Black Crowes. The coaches complimented the singer’s rasp, on top of other musical elements, of course. It was clear that Huntley is a seasoned performer and Reba McEntire couldn’t agree more, since she compared Huntley’s vocals to country star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Stapleton</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the episode, Huntley’s daughter, Stella, admitted that she wants her dad to join Team Reba. To help Huntley pick his team, Stella came on stage with him. Stella picked Team Niall for her father. This was surprising since her portion of Huntley’s package was about how much Stella likes McEntire.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>felt like we were LISTENING to angels during Huntley's rendition of "She Talks To Angels" 😇🎶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4iNaE82rVC</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-early-release-singer-performs-his-mother-s-funeral-song>Early Release Singer Performs His Mother’s Funeral Song</h2><p>20 year old singer, Dylan Carter decided to put his heart on the line for his The Voice audition. The young singer came to the stage performing “I Look to You” by Whitney Houston. The last time he sang the song was at his own mother’s funeral.</p><p>Ahead of the episode, The Voice fans were able to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this audition</a> on the show’s YouTube Channel. Within the YouTube footage, Gwen Stefani turned her chair first, followed by John Legend, Niall Horan, and Reba McEntire.</p><p>McEntire was seen getting emotional over Dylan’s emotional rendition. While complimenting the singer, McEntire commented on how the song touched her.</p><p>“That’s when you know you’ve got a great song and a great singer, when it touches your heart,” she said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>this small-town boy SANG!! 🎶 Dylan Carter just got an immediate 4-chair turn👏👏👏👏 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zZti4Qvz0f</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a><p>Horan then joked that Dylan “made the queen cry.” Following all the coach compliments, Dylan had a big choice coming his way. Dylan decided to join Team Reba, finalizing the first ever Team Reba.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-niall-horan-completes-team-with-unique-singer>Niall Horan Completes Team With Unique Singer</h2><p>One of the final singers of the episode was Lennon VanderDoes. He came to the stage to perform Lord Huron’s “The Night We Met.” The coaches couldn’t believe Lennon’s look when they turned around. His voice was so unique that it was unimaginable to visualize what he looked like. It was more than clear that Lennon would’ve gotten a Four-Chair turn, if McEntire’s team wasn’t already full.</p><p>While talking to the coaches, Lennon admitted that his unique voice originally deferred him from coming on the show sooner. According to the singer, he didn’t think that a voice like his belonged on the series. Horan, naturally as a songwriter himself, connected the most with the singer, so it wasn’t a surprise for Lennon to pick his team.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@lennonvmusic</a> is singing <a href=#>@lordhuron</a>'s "The Night We Met" so EFFORTLESSLY✨ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yF0TNhl3X8</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-soul-singer-impresses-has-to-pick-between-team-legend-or-gwen>Soul Singer Impresses, Has to Pick Between Team Legend or Gwen</h2><p>One of the final singers of the night, Taylor Deenan, sang an impressive cover of “Redbone” by Childish Gambino. Her energetic rendition turned the chairs of both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a> and John Legend. Following the song, the 23 year old was told by Horan that his and Reba’s teams are completely full, or they would’ve turned.</p><p>Right away, it was clear that Taylor was a huge fan of Legend. Within her package, Taylor is seen talking about her excitement about the singer. Although both Legend and Stefani sweet talked the singer, she decided to pick Team Legend. To further rub it in Stefani’s face, Legend sang a song on the spot, about his team being full.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>STUNNED by <a href=#>@itstaylordeneen</a> giving us this flawless "Redbone" rendition 🤭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zzlt33hDyI</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gwen-stefani-completes-her-team>Gwen Stefani Completes Her Team</h2><p>The final singer of the night, Calla Prejean came to the stage singing “She’s So Vain” by Carly Simon. Stefani quickly turned her chair for Calla, since she loved her song choice. Upon turning around, the singer learned that all of the other teams were filled.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>you're sooo ICONIC <a href=#>@iamcallamusic</a>, for belting this <a href=#>@carlysimonhq</a> classic 🤗🎶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z6DHmFkSB7</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a><p>In turn, Calla had the opportunity to join Team Gwen, which honestly seemed like a great fit for her. The Voice returns to NBC on Tuesday, October 17 at 9 p.m. ET for the beginning of The Battle Rounds.
