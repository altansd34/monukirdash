Due to their on-show antics, the public fell for their bromance. Many were drawn into thinking that the two had a deep connection outside of the show. However, that narrative doesn’t seem fit with the current situation. An insider recently reported that Shelton’s wife, Stefani, has allegedly demanded him to cut Levine off.</p><p>This issue comes recently after the “Payphone” singer faced a cheating controversy involving Instagram model Sumner Stroh. In the past month, Levine has become the subject of ugly gossip despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">denying affair allegations.</a></p><p>“She isn’t worried about Adam being a bad influence [on Blake], this is about principle,” the insider told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Radar</a>.</p><p>If the rumors are true, Stefani is understandably indignant about the scandal, coming from a broken marriage caused by infidelity. According to the source who claims to be close with the couple, Levine’s controversy is “personal” for the pop icon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Couple Didn’t Invite Levine to Their Wedding</h2><p>If don’t remember, the three celebrities have previously worked together as celebrity coaches on The Voice. Nevertheless, while Shelton’s close relationship with Levine seemed real on TV, a different source once claimed that their banters were intentionally exaggerated.</p><p>A deeper dive into the issue has largely proved that the couple doesn’t really have a strong bond with the “This Love” singer. Even though Levine was one of the coaches that witnessed the spark between Shelton and Stefani’s romance, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t receive an invite to their wedding</a>.</p><p>In Levine’s past appearance in The Ellen DeGeneres Show, he mentioned that he would cause a scene if he’s invited in the ceremony. He further stated that he expects to not receive any invite because of his unpleasant comments.</p><p>Shelton and Stefani have neither confirmed nor denied the issue. At the moment, the couple is fighting against one another in The Voice season 22. Meanwhile, Levine is preparing for his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas residency</a> with the rest of Maroon 5.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HowieMandel_MeghanMarkle.jpg alt="Meghan Markle Quit ‘Deal or No Deal’ Because It Was All About Looks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xrCcp2WjqbKnrc2iZJqknJq0prDLsmSaq5uoeqO4wKScZquYmrm1u81mq6hlk6rBbsDInqpmr5mptW6tw5qkZqSVq7avsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
