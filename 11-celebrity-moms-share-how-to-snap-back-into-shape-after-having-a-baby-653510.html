In&nbsp;fact, her favorite go-to meals included homemade soups or&nbsp;fish with leafy greens like kale or&nbsp;spinach and brown rice. “Her soup isn’t just soup&nbsp;— there are probably lots of&nbsp;vegetables and beans, so&nbsp;it’s filling,” <a href=#>says her trainer</a>.</p><p><h2>Alessandra Ambrosio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69e/f9a/d03ff65bd39dfc499a4008b009.jpg><p>Eating tiny portions, brown rice instead of&nbsp;white, and lots of&nbsp;salads helped this <a href=#>Victoria Secret model</a> to&nbsp;lose weight.
