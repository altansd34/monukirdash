We&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;share what we&nbsp;have found out, and we&nbsp;invite you to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;look into the inner world of&nbsp;men!</p><p><h2>The breastfeeding period might block fathers from connecting with their children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2f/de9/26e3f553c493e6362e64191cd5.jpg><p>While breastfeeding is&nbsp;a&nbsp;special mother-baby time that deepens the connection between them, some fathers can feel left out. Some of&nbsp;them even think that this process influences the creation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bond with their child, and also their spousal <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. This creates a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stress for fathers, which can make them feel jealous or&nbsp;depressed.</p><p><h2>This can result in&nbsp;him being dissatisfied with himself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/109/665/24b48158d093f16df40ff9f525.jpg><p>Feeling excluded can also influence some fathers’ self-esteem and self-efficacy. Because they are not always allowed to&nbsp;fully participate in&nbsp;the baby’s life and provide them with necessary care, they feel that they are not competent enough and are helpless as&nbsp;fathers. These negative emotions even lead to&nbsp;arguments with their wives, the research reports.</p><p><h2>Acting together makes men feel united as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4a/6d6/59dc9d53a6851e188b5cdec9f0.jpg><p>Men understand that mothers play the main role in&nbsp;breastfeeding and respect their decisions. On&nbsp;the other hand, some men reported that they enjoyed participating in&nbsp;the process like discussing the details and benefits with their significant others. They saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“negotiating a&nbsp;space for themselves within the decision-making process”. All in&nbsp;all, fathers highly value acting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;team, trying to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the best for their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/789/967/3d660d5c97aafcab96c7ad9dae.jpg><p>Many fathers believe that during the breastfeeding period, their role is&nbsp;to&nbsp;support and facilitate the process. They think it’s important to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;their partner, provide food, help with chores, look after older children, and even take care of&nbsp;the infant. The emotional support and encouragement of&nbsp;their partners, just like breastfeeding, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;commendable activity that contributes to&nbsp;the family “team.”</p><p><h2>They would gladly take on&nbsp;the feeding responsibility.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43c/45b/7dc5c45c6ab7ada63c429f5ed4.jpg><p>Another interesting finding reports that fathers think very positively about feeding the baby themselves with formula or&nbsp;breastmilk. This helps them to&nbsp;form a&nbsp;connection with their child, and better feel and understand their emotions&nbsp;— like satisfaction or&nbsp;discontent. And one thing that is&nbsp;very important is&nbsp;that bottle-feeding can make some of&nbsp;them feel that they are contributing to&nbsp;the baby’s development. One father even stated that feeding his son “helped remind him that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;father.”</p><p><h2>And they are eager to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;even more responsibilities.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/190/d25/b173035e23b668bef93a48bf4d.jpg><p>Letting fathers get closely involved in&nbsp;the breastfeeding process can have a&nbsp;positive effect on&nbsp;both partners. Mothers might reconsider their views and allow their men to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the baby. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;showing them how to&nbsp;recognize hunger, calming the baby, changing diapers, and cleaning them after a&nbsp;feeding. At&nbsp;the end, taking care of&nbsp;the baby together can help both partners to&nbsp;make their relationship stronger, and allow the baby to&nbsp;receive a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> from both of&nbsp;their parents.</p><p>How did your breastfeeding period&nbsp;go?
