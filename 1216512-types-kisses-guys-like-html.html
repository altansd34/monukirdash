Lip kiss</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19bfe72aa0770800.jpg><p class=align-left>A gentle and romantic way of showing love can be a lovely single lip kiss.

You should not also press your lips to the lips of your man; let the lips be relaxed.</p><p class=align-left>Start s*cking the lip gently in a romantic manner. Play with the guy's lips gently, sandwich one of their lips between yours, and keep s*cking to send a solid romantic message.</p><h3>2. Tongue or French kiss</h3><p class=align-left>French kissing is the perfect way to show him how passionate you are. This is the most popular kiss, and men love it a lot.</p><p class=align-left>It involves not only lips but also tongues. Start by sticking your tongue out just a little bit and then use it to softly massage and caress his lips.</p><p class=align-left>Your man should take the hint and will start doing the same. Once he opens his mouth a bit and sticks his tongue out, then you can begin to massage it with yours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/deb631b5ebef21bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get over someone you love – best tips</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do not strain your tongue, and do not leave it in his mouth for too long. You can also add smooth biting movements separately on the upper lip, then on the lower lip. This should be done carefully because the skin of the lips is tender.</p><h3>3. "Sparkling" kiss</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to play a little with the texture, taste, and smell:</p><ul><li>Try to add to your kiss some champagne or something else with a sparkling or creamy structure.</li><li>Drink a small sip of the selected drink and leave a little of it on your lips.</li><li>Look for food items that you both love to binge on, like ice cream, marshmallow fluff, chocolate, etc., and kiss while they melt in your mouth.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Who says snacking can't be romantic!</p><h3>4.
