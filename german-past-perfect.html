The Plusquamperfekt allows you to talk about past events in chronological order. This makes it useful for telling stories that take place across a  timeline (as many stories do). For example, if you want to tell your German-speaking friends that you first attended aGerman course and then went to the cinema, the Plusquamperfekt helps to clarify the order of these events."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The answer — in German, at least — lies in a verb tense known as the Plusquamperfekt (past perfect).&nbsp;</p><p>The Plusquamperfekt allows you to talk about past events in chronological order. This makes it useful for telling stories that take place across a&nbsp; timeline (as many stories do). For example, if you want to tell your German-speaking friends that you first attended a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> German course</a> and then went to the cinema, the Plusquamperfekt helps to clarify the order of these events.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s explore the German past perfect tense together. We’ll review when to use it, and how the past perfect is formed.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-the-German-past-perfect-tense>When to use the German past perfect tense</h2><p>The Plusquamperfekt describes events or actions that happened before other events or actions in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>The Plusquamperfekt is typically used in combination with a sentence in the Präteritum (simple past) or Perfekt (perfect). Sometimes, it’s necessary to express that an action took place even earlier than another action in the<a href=#> past</a> — usually to demonstrate the influence of the prior action on an outcome.</p><p>For example, say you studied a lot for your<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> German language certificate</a> and then succeeded on your test. In order to tell your German-speaking friends the whole story of how your studying led to your success, you would use the Plusquamperfekt in combination with the Perfekt:</p><p>Ich <strong>hatte</strong> viel für das Deutschzertifikat <strong>gelernt</strong>, deswegen habe ich den Test bestanden. (I <strong>had</strong> <strong>studied</strong> a lot for the German certificate, and therefore I passed the test.)</p><p>In this example, the past perfect is used to show the correlation between two events (studying and passing), and to demonstrate that one event (studying) was already over by the time the second (passing the test) began.</p><p>If you’re already familiar with the German perfect tense, you should have little difficulty with the past perfect tense, as both are formed according to the same principle.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-form-the-German-past-perfect>How to form the German past perfect</h2><p>To form the past perfect in German, you need an <strong>auxiliary verb</strong> and the <strong>past participle of the verb you want to</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong> conjugate</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, the auxiliary verb will be either haben (to have) or sein (to be).&nbsp;</p><p>The principle is similar to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> forming the perfect</a>, only now the auxiliary verb is formed using the simple past tense (rather than the present tense). This signals that the action happened before another event in the past.</p><p>Here’s how to form the past perfect in German:</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Simple past of</strong><strong> haben</strong><strong> + past participle</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Simple past of </strong><strong>sein</strong><strong> + past participle</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How to conjugate haben in the Plusquamperfekt</h3><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject</strong></td><td><strong>Present</strong></td><td><strong>Simple past</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ich</td><td>habe</td><td>hatte</td></tr><tr><td>du</td><td>hast</td><td>hattest</td></tr><tr><td>er/sie/es</td><td>hat</td><td>hatte</td></tr><tr><td>wir</td><td>haben</td><td>hatten</td></tr><tr><td>ihr</td><td>habt</td><td>hattet</td></tr><tr><td>Sie/sie</td><td>haben</td><td>hatten</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How to conjugate sein in the Plusquamperfekt</h3><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Person</strong></td><td><strong>Present</strong></td><td><strong>Simple past</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ich</td><td>bin</td><td>war</td></tr><tr><td>du</td><td>bist</td><td>warst</td></tr><tr><td>er/sie/es</td><td>ist</td><td>war</td></tr><tr><td>wir</td><td>sind</td><td>waren</td></tr><tr><td>ihr</td><td>seid</td><td>wart</td></tr><tr><td>Sie/sie</td><td>sind</td><td>waren</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Past-perfect-examples>Past perfect examples</h2><p>The past perfect is often used in<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> storytelling</a>. How else would you be able to make clear the sequence in which several actions or events happened in the past?&nbsp;</p><p>As you will see in these examples, the past perfect often occurs in combination with other past tenses. If you need to refresh your memory a little, here’s how the different past tenses compare in form and translation:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Present</strong></td><td><strong>Simple past</strong></td><td><strong>Perfect</strong></td><td><strong>Past perfect</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Ich sehe.</td><td>Ich sah.</td><td>Ich habe gesehen.</td><td>Ich hatte gesehen.</td></tr><tr><td>I see.</td><td>I saw.</td><td>I have seen.</td><td>I had seen.</td></tr><tr><td>Ich schwimme</td><td>Ich schwamm.</td><td>Ich bin geschwommen.</td><td>Ich war geschwommen.</td></tr><tr><td>I swim.</td><td>I swam.</td><td>I have swum.</td><td>I had swum.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The past perfect can be used on its own, but this is rare. After all, its chief purpose is to define the timeline between two past events.</p><p>When the past perfect is used in longer sentences, there are certain signaling words that can help you spot it. These include <strong>zuvor</strong> (before) <strong>zuerst</strong> (at first), <strong>nachdem</strong> (after) and <strong>bevor</strong> (before). For example:</p><p>Bevor ich ihn <strong>gesehen hatte</strong>, dachte ich er kommt nicht. (Before I <strong>had seen</strong> him, I thought he wouldn’t come.)</p><p>In the above example, the first part of the sentence uses the past perfect (gesehen hatte), while the verb in the second part is set in simple past (dachte). Here’s another example:</p><p>Zuvor <strong>war</strong> er viel <strong>gereist</strong>, dann <strong>hat</strong> er sie <strong>getroffen</strong>. (Before, he <strong>had previously traveled</strong> a lot, then he <strong>met</strong> her.)</p><p>Here, the verb in the first part of the sentence is set in the past perfect (war gereist), while the verb in the second part of the sentence is set in the perfect (hat getroffen).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Telling stories with the German past perfect tense</h2><p>If you already know how to form the Perfekt (perfect tense) in German, the Plusquamperfekt (past perfect) shouldn’t cause you any trouble. As the past perfect is one step “deeper” into the past than the perfect tense, you must use the simple past of sein or haben. After that, you add the past participle — just like you would when using the perfect tense.&nbsp;</p><p>The past perfect helps you to state that something happened before a certain point in time and makes it easier for your readers or listeners to understand the stories you tell.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lea-Hauke-Foto-1-1.jpg><h2>Lea Hauke</h2><p>Lea is a writer and translator for English and German and lives in Austria.
