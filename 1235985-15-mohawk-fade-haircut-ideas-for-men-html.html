Edgy wide mohawk</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/52f4eeccd48a9082.png><p class=align-left>In the past, this hairstyle was known as a sign of rebels and people who want to be edgy. If you would like to add a little spark of rebellion to your image, but still maintain your professional look and combine it with your avant-garde style in a balanced way, you can go for this one. The fade here adds some texture and volume to the hairstyle and nicely phases into the beard.</p><h3>2. Faded mohawk with original designs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c9756373e57310e2.jpg><p class=align-left>You can start bringing excitement into your life, starting with the haircut change. You can opt for the regular option with the hair slicked back and usual fade area, or you can go a little crazy and shave some interesting designs on the sides of your head. Remember that such a choice needs maintenance and frequent trimming, though.</p><h3>3. Curly blonde style with dark roots</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/804e4b47f765facb.jpg><p class=align-left>Quite often, we see all these options where the roots and the hairstyle are of the same colour, and we just want something new and fresh. Well, it comes with the decision to dye your curls and style them in a frohawk kind of way. This interesting word is a combination of afro and mohawk, and it is prevalent among those people who have afro-textured locks. What is also interesting about this style are small stripes in the fading area, the purpose of which is to add some originality.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60fe7689a1f25c69.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The simplest tutorial for the cutest space buns</span></p></a><h3>4.

In this example, we see a spunky haircut which makes emphasis on your playful personality. Notice how the fade starts under the main bunch of hair and then gradually vanishes. Another thing which is worth noticing about this style is the sideburns.</p><h3>5. Another spiky style with fade art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60fe7689a1f25c69.jpg><p class=align-left>The fading area can be a good canvas for expressing yourself. So, if you are bold, fast and have a fiery personality, you can shave sharp, edgy designs on your head. The spiky fade style will only add spirited vibe to your look and help you approach new people with confidence. The beard which starts from the fade will only be an additional perk of this look.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Dreadlock styles for ladies and gentlemen</p><h3>6.

A special feature of this hairstyle is not only the soft hair which everyone would want to touch but also the interesting fade type which reaches the beard. The fading technique starts on top of the head, and by the time it gets to the beard, it is barely visible. Such a choice attracts more attention to the haircut.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7777cf204a8810c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best new braid hairstyles for your lovely look</span></p></a><h3>9.

Red afro with imaginative fade designs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fbebe57883f3d7c8.jpg><p class=align-left>The frohawk like this can blow away people's minds because it looks so out of this world.
