Many factors affect how fast an individual learns a language, and these factors tend to be different for everyone. They include your native language, personal motivation, language goals and the resources and tools you choose to employ.</p><p>To give you some more clarity on how long it realistically takes to learn German, let’s dive in.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-long-does-it-take-to-learn-German?>How long does it take to learn German?</h2><p>The mother of all questions doesn’t have a straightforward answer. As for all the goals you put your mind to, plenty of aspects may affect your journey towards fluency. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Your language goals.</strong> What do you want to achieve? What level of fluency do you aim to reach? How do you picture yourself using the language in a week, a month or a year? Answering these questions will help you set realistic milestones for your language-learning journey.</li><li><strong>Your native language (and any second language you speak).</strong> Depending on your linguistic foundation and previous experience with second languages, your journey to fluency will vary. German is considered one of the more complex languages spoken in Western Europe. But being fluent in a close relative such as Dutch, for instance, can speed up the learning process.</li><li><strong>Exposure to German.</strong> What chances do you have to actively or passively practice your German skills? What are you doing to find conversation and immersion opportunities? The more you practice and actively use a language, the faster you learn.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resources.</strong> Are you studying by yourself or attending regular German classes? Are the materials you use diversified? Whether you prefer completing grammar exercises or passively listening to your favorite podcast, you’ll enrich your learning experience by using as many tools and approaches as possible.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your motivation and discipline.</strong> How much are you willing (or able) to invest in terms of time and dedication to achieve your language goal?</li></ul><p>“OK, but it can’t be all on me! There must be some time reference!” Well, there are some general benchmarks we can point to. Depending on the amount of lessons and hours per week you commit, the breakdown may look like this:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=0.84042553191489><tr><td><strong>Proficiency level</strong></td><td><strong>20 lessons/week</strong></td><td><strong>30 lessons/week</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German A1</a></td><td>8 weeks (up to 150 hrs)</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German A2</a></td><td>8 weeks (up to 260 hrs)</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German B1</a></td><td>8 weeks (up to 490 hrs)</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German B2</a></td><td>8 weeks (up to 600 hrs)</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr readability=1.5609756097561><td><a href=#>German C1</a></td><td>personal* (up to 750 hrs)</td><td>6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>German C2</td><td>personal* (750+ hrs)</td><td>personal*</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>German is considered a Category II language in terms of its proximity to English. Based on that, fluency is potentially achieved by investing at least 750 hours of study.</p><p>* Personal commitment and consistency are the main factors influencing the achievement of those levels.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-long-does-it-take-to-learn-C1-German?>How long does it take to learn C1 German?</h2><p>Assuming a minimum of 20 lessons per week, it takes anywhere<strong> between 600 and 750 hours</strong> to reach C1.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (or CEFR), reaching a C1 level means you are able to “[…] understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognize implicit meaning. […] use language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes. […] produce clear, well-structured, detailed text on complex subjects, […]”.</p><p>This is, of course, an approximate time range, but reaching this lower advanced level means professional opportunities will open, too. At this stage of your journey, your proficiency will allow you to use the language in almost all contexts.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Can-I-learn-German-in-three-months?>Can I learn German in three months?</h2><p>The overall answer is yes, you can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn German</a> in three months. The key question is: how much fluency can you realistically achieve in such a short timeframe?&nbsp; Generally speaking, after three months of consistent practice and, you should have no problem building a solid foundation of German grammar rules, syntax and vocabulary. This will allow you to communicate at an intermediate level on subjects such as:</p><ul><li>Recurring matters happening in home, work or school environments</li><li>Situations likely to arise while traveling</li><li>Experiences, events, dreams and ambitions</li></ul><p>While the proficiency level you reach in three months might not be sufficient to land that dream position, your everyday conversations and writing skills will have developed enough for you to communicate on a daily basis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-lingoda-can-help-you-learn-german>How Lingoda can help you learn German</h2><p>In this article, we gave you a comprehensive overview of the factors influencing how long it takes to learn German. If we take into account solely the number of lessons per week, reaching a C1 level entails a minimum of 750 hours. Any more time spent on the language will propel you towards bilingual proficiency. In reality, however, there’s much more to consider.</p><p>Are you a lone wolf, or would you rather share the experience in an online class?
