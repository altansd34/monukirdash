This does not include the Free Trial as it is not an active subscription. Upon registering for the Sprint Promotion, you automatically sign up for a two-month subscription. The payments will be automatically charged from your selected payment method upon registration and 23 September 2024. To foster the skills learned during the Sprint Promotion, your course automatically rolls into a regular Lingoda subscription after the Sprint Promotion is over. If you would like a break after your Sprint, you can change your post-Sprint subscription during the last month of the Sprint Promotion.</p></li><li readability=-1.4741379310345><h2>What are the Language Sprint rules?</h2><p>You can download all Language Sprint rules <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>. Please familiarise yourself with them. You need to follow all the Language Sprint rules as well as Lingoda’s T&Cs in order to earn your cashback.</p></li><li readability=2.780487804878><h2>What languages and at which levels can I learn them?</h2><p>You can learn English and German from A1 to C1, French, Spanish and Business English from A1 to B2. Italian is only available for A1.</p><p>Complete a placement test and find out your level.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>German</a><br><a href=# rel=noopener>English</a><br><a href=# rel=noopener>French</a><br><a href=# rel=noopener>Spanish</a><br><a href=#>Italian</a></p><p>Change your level at any time during the Language Sprint if you ﬁnd it too easy or diﬃcult or if you’ve completed a level. This will not aﬀect your refund eligibility.</p></li><li readability=3.5><h2>How do I complete the Language Sprint and get the reward?</h2><p>All classes must be taken in the respective months of the Language Sprint:</p><p>For regular Sprint: 15 classes in Month 1 and 15 classes in Month 2.<br>For Super Sprint: 30 classes in Month 1 and 30 classes in Month 2.</p><p>A Sprint Promotion month is defined as follows:</p><p>– Month 1 – from 1st September 2024 (00:00) to 30 September 2024 (23:59)<br>– Month 2 – from 1st October 2024 (00:00) to 30 October 2024 (23:59)</p><p>You can’t take more classes than stated above during the Sprint runtime. You also can’t take more than 1 class a day for Sprint and Super Sprint and not more than 5 classes per week for Sprint.</p></li><li readability=-1><h2>Is it difficult?</h2><p>The Language Sprint is designed to be a challenge and push your boundaries! Depending on your motivation it might feel hard or not. But thousands of students who succeeded before will testify that the effort is worth it for the language skills – and 14.000 of them earned the cashback.</p></li><li readability=-0.5><h2>Who are my teachers?</h2><p>Teachers at Lingoda are experienced professionals who love to teach. They are qualiﬁed, native-level speakers from all over the world. They will teach you versatile language skills and cultural insights into diﬀerent social and workplace situations.</p></li><li readability=0><h2>Are the course materials included?</h2><p>You can download all course materials for free from your account. No additional materials or textbooks are required. Plus, Lingoda offers homework and a quiz after your lessons, so you can keep practising.</p></li><li readability=5><h2>What if I miss a class?</h2><p>If it’s due to confirmed technical issues on Lingoda’s side, the class will still count towards your Language Sprint. Once we have conﬁrmation that the fault lies with Lingoda, we will update your account and refund your class credit. Please note, you can only use the refunded credit after the challenge ends. Using it during the Language Sprint (e.g. 16 classes in Month 2 of the Sprint instead of 15 classes) will result in you no longer being eligible for a cashback.</p><p>If you missed the class due to problems on your side, you are no longer eligible for a refund.</p><p>You can, of course, continue taking your Language Sprint classes and developing your language skills!</p></li><li readability=2.5><h2>How and when do I receive my cashback reward if I win?</h2><p>After the Language Sprint ends, The Student Team will check if you’re eligible for a refund. This first part can take up to 2 weeks. If you qualify, we will send you your cashback (50% of the total amount you paid for the Sprint or the Super Sprint) to the same payment method you used to pay for the Language Sprint. Please note you can also choose to receive class credits of a higher value instead of money and continue learning (30 classes for Sprint, 60 classes for Super Sprint). This second part, the refund itself, can take up to 4 weeks. So in total, the process can take approximately 40-45 days.</p></li><li readability=0.5><h2>I'm a Lingoda student and want to do the Language Sprint. How can I participate?</h2><p>You can join the Language Sprint as long as you never had an active Lingoda subscription before. Existing students can participate in the Language Sprint, but are automatically excluded from the rewards (cashback or free credits). Alternatively, you can choose one of our more intense monthly packages (i.e. 20 or 40 classes per month).</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sprint-faq-img.png><p class=toggle-heading>Thank you!</p><p>We will be in contact soon.</p>Sent<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consultation-modal-img-d.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consultation-modal-img-m.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/snap-2024.svg><p class=toggle-heading>Thanks for subscribing!</p><p>Check your inbox and confirm your email address to receive offers and updates on our Italian courses.</p>Close window<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sprint-popup-img-oct2023-def1.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sprint-popup-snap.svg><h2 class=toggle-heading>Thanks for subscribing!</h2><p>Check your inbox and confirm your email address to receive offers and updates on the upcoming Language Sprints</p>Close windowClose Window<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57xKdmrKiinru1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
