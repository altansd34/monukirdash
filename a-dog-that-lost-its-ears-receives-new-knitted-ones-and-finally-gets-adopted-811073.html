While his owner wasn’t home, the other dogs managed to&nbsp;push down the fence in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the garden and attack Willy. When the owner got back, he&nbsp;found Willy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very bad state, with both of&nbsp;his ears severely injured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e0/3a6/2103305b82a31b78ff90d55bbe.jpg><p>Willy was rushed to&nbsp;the veterinary hospital and both his ears needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;amputated. However, his inner ear canals didn’t suffer any damage, so&nbsp;<strong>his hearing is&nbsp;still intact</strong>. The owner decided to&nbsp;leave Willy with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sacramento SPCA</a> since the cost of&nbsp;Willy’s care after the attack increased so&nbsp;much. He&nbsp;was also afraid that another attack might happen again at&nbsp;some point.</p><p>The people at&nbsp;the center knew exactly how to&nbsp;care for Willy and made sure to&nbsp;replace the sutures and keep the wounds clean. Willy was a&nbsp;big hit with everyone at&nbsp;the center and they started calling him “Sweet Willy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21d/7b5/59e46e5f798367783d575981d9.jpg><p>John Holmquist, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;veterinary technician, was also taking care of&nbsp;Willy and decided to&nbsp;<strong>crochet him a&nbsp;new set of&nbsp;ears</strong>. He&nbsp;did so&nbsp;by&nbsp;attaching the “ears” to&nbsp;a&nbsp;band that could go&nbsp;around Willy’s head. The colors chosen from the ears and band matched the dog’s fur perfectly and made him look even prettier. Also, this accessory would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;help them find a&nbsp;home for Willy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21e/119/ad472759eba65b27b69292f0d1.jpg><p>The pictures of&nbsp;Willy gathered a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention online and many people showed interest in&nbsp;adopting him. <strong>One family took him home</strong> with them but had to&nbsp;return him the next day since their other dog wasn’t very welcoming of&nbsp;Willy. Fortunately, a&nbsp;few days later, another person adopted him, and hopefully, this will be&nbsp;his home for a&nbsp;really long time.</p><p>Have you ever adopted a&nbsp;dog that seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;everyone else’s last choice?
