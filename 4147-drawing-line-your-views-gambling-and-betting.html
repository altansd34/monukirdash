You discussed the harm vs. harmlessness of gambling</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-30</div><p>Deputy Labour Party Leader, Harriet Harman, said recently that New Labour’s decision to open up different forms of gambling in the UK with the Gambling Act of 2005, had been a ‘mistake’ – and that measures it had implemented needed reversing.</p><p>Ms Harman told <a href=#>Channel 4’s Dispatches Programme</a> that she has received numerous letters and e-mails detailing the detrimental effects that the Gambling Act has had, both in her constituency and in many other deprived areas across the country.</p><p>“If we had known then what we know now,” she expanded, “we wouldn’t have allowed this, because it’s not just ruining the high street, it’s ruining people’s lives."</p><p><a href=#>Academic research has suggested</a> however that most people who take part in gambling do not develop a problem, and that many see it as a harmless activity to be indulged in from time to time.</p><h3><b>But how did participants in Labs perceive the matter? We posed the question:</b></h3><h2><b>Do you think there is a point at which gambling or betting can cross a line from being a harmless activity to becoming a problem, or not?</b></h2><h3><b>The largest proportion of people taking part to give their views in Labs believed there IS a point at which gambling or betting can cross a line from harmless to harmful, for both the gambler and family alike. <img alt height src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2012-08-14/HP-SadAngryCouple%20(2).jpg width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></b></h3><ul><li>The <b>vast majority of participants</b> argued that gambling becomes a widespread problem when it <b>causes high levels of addiction.</b> Similarly, a large number of<b> participants equated gambling addictions with that of drug and alcohol addictions.</b></li><li>Some participants noted that <b>gambling becomes more of a serious problem</b> when people spend so much money that they cannot afford the basic necessities of life, with the problem becoming so <b>severe that gambling or betting addicts cannot afford food.</b> In addition, participants noted that <b>family members are likely to suffer greatly from gambling addictions,</b> with the problem becomes so severe that not only do gamblers lose their job, but their <b>family suffers directly as a result of the gamblers addiction.</b></li><li>Additionally, some <b>participants noted that gambling crosses a line and becomes a serious problem when vulnerable people are involved. </b>On the whole, the perception is that these people live in <b>poorer areas and</b> will have less networks of support from family and friends to deal with the <b>gambling addiction.</b></li><li>Another perception was that the <b>rise of online gambling and super casinos</b> has contributed to the point at which gambling and betting becomes a <b>serious problem.</b></li></ul><h3><b>Below are some comments from panellists, representative of the sorts of things those who took part said on the topic:</b></h3><p>“<b>Gambling is an addiction</b> which is as <b>pernicious </b>as drugs or alcohol.” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“When it threatens your <b>lifestyle and family</b>.” <i>Andy B</i>, Aylesbury</p><p>“You have to know when to stop. <b>Betting every day is not good</b> and I know lots of people who have <b>lost everything through gambling even their homes.”</b> <i>Anon</i></p><p>“I think there are <b>far too many opportunities</b> for people to gamble today, particularly online, and these are being encouraged and advertised to those who can least afford to and <b>people lose money on games of chance. </b>I find an annual flutter on a horse race such as the Grand National to be an acceptable bit of fun, in moderation, <b>but on balance I think our gambling controls have become far too lax.</b> The National Lottery has been a mixed blessing; I used to do it, but no longer do. Too many people, I believe, are seduced into seeing gambling as a way out of their problems, greedily anticipating large wins which, in reality, they are never likely to have but instead find themselves with <b>less and less money.”</b> <i>Mark S,</i> Middlesex</p><p>“Gambling targets the<b> most vulnerable people</b>, <b>low income and people on benefits</b> as they try to win <b>money, they hardly ever do</b>.” <i>Rosie S</i>, London</p><p>“If you are putting your finances in danger, <b>then you've crossed a line.</b> Going to Las Vegas, gambling every day is fine <b>if you can afford it, but if you're spending more than you can realistically afford, then its bad news.”</b> <i>Nikki L</i>, Carmarthenshire</p><h3><b>Only a handful of MediaLab participants felt, by contrast, that there was NOT a point at which gambling or betting could become harmful rather than harmless. They felt that most people had enough self-control that gambling did not need more stringent controls.</b></h3><ul><li>Participants with this view often noted that individuals who have <b>high levels of self-control</b> <span>can</span> stop gambling and betting from becoming more of a <b>widespread problem.</b></li><li><b>One participant noted that a large part of controlling the threat of a person’s gambling activities escalating and becoming a problem, “</b>depends on <b>people’s temperament rather than what is out there to tempt them</b>.”</li><li>Additionally, another participant remarked that: “It's down to <b>self-control.</b> You shouldn't <b>bet more than you can afford to.”<span></span></b></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGaBeHnDq5iwoZ6ceq21zZ5ksqelp3q3tcSwqmafkaKvrbXNoGSappRir6bA06KloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
