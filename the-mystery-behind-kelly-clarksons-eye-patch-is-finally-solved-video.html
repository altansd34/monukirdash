The singer wore an eye patch as she interviewed rapper Common on the show. Everyone had the same question, why?</strong> <strong>Well, now we finally have answers.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Clarkson Reveals Why She Wore An Eye Patch</h2><p>Immediately when Kelly sat down with Common, she apologized about her eye patch. “First of all, I’m sorry I look like a pirate,” she told the rapper. “I hurt my eye and I have to wear it. And, so, it’s ridiculous. You’re being interviewed by a pirate today.” But Common was a good sport and replied “You look fly with your pirate thing.” Kelly joked that she would make it her new look. “This is my whole album, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my next album cycle</a> is this,” The Voice coach said pointing to the eye patch.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> KELLY CLARKSON FIRST TIME SPEAKS OPENLY ABOUT HER DIVORCE AND IT’LL GET EMOTIONAL [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>During an appearance on NBC Los Angeles’&nbsp;California Live&nbsp;Kelly further explained that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she sustained the injury</a> during a shoot for the upcoming season of The Voice. The show is filming in the Universal lot on sets that she claims are full of dust. Kelly is severely allergic to dust and believes a piece of it went into her eye. This caused her eye to swell up in what she compared to a scene from the movie Hitch.</p><p>“When it first happened, it was so puffy and I was like, ‘What am I supposed to do?’ I had to shoot The Voice, a full day for, I think it was Battle Realities, in a patch and I was wearing all black cause it was already the outfit that was chosen and I looked like an assassin,” she said. Because the shows will not air in the order that they are taped, Kelly thinks The Voice fans will be confused about her eye patch when they are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>watching it on television.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“We did six shows total because we did two shows a day. Three days I had to wear a patch. Those are not consecutive, man,” she continued. “I’m gonna randomly be wearing a patch, like on a random Tuesday and people are going to be like, ‘She needs to figure out her eye situation.'”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Was In Good Spirits While Going Through Divorce</h3><p>Only Kelly can joke around about looking like a pirate while also going through a very difficult time in her life. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>filed for divorce</a> in June from her husband of nearly seven years Brandon Blackstock. During the season two premiere of The Kelly Clarkson Show, she got candid with fans about how her life is changing. “As you probably know, 2020 has brought a lot of change also to my personal life,” she said. “Definitely didn’t see anything coming that came, but what I’m dealing with is hard — it involves more than just my heart, it involves a lot of little hearts.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>KELLY CLARKSON SHOCKINGLY CURSES DURING FAMILY-FRIENDLY SHOW [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>If you want to catch Kelly rocking her eye patch like only she can on The Voice, it premieres on October 19 on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Masked-Singer-Snow-Owls.jpeg alt="Who Are The Snow Owls? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction and All the Clues Decoded!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWpqMGmvthmmZ6gmaOxbrfEpaOyZZOhrrO30qilrGWVrrJuvMCtmqFlmah6p7XNmqOlsV2ovK3CxJ1kr6GUmrxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
