His daughter, Sofia Richie Grainge, had just given <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby girl, and Lionel couldn’t contain his excitement.</p><p>He&nbsp;affectionately referred to&nbsp;his newborn granddaughter as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“diva” in&nbsp;the video. Lionel has always been vocal about how much he&nbsp;loves being a&nbsp;grandfather, and his enthusiasm in&nbsp;the video caught the attention of&nbsp;many online, sparking a&nbsp;debate about his endearing nickname for the baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e33/2e9/5550b1514ebbadb2e2fe80dc0f.jpg><p>Previously, Lionel Richie had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> his thoughts on&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;grandfather, mentioning that it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;exciting adventure for him. However, he&nbsp;had stated that he&nbsp;wasn’t particularly fond of&nbsp;being called “grandpa” and preferred the nickname “Pop-pop” instead.</p><p>Even though Lionel’s message was sweet, lots of&nbsp;folks online were more into talking about how he&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;the video than what he&nbsp;was saying. <a href=# title="Social media" data-link=tag>Social media</a> lit up&nbsp;with comments, with people wondering if&nbsp;Lionel had done something to&nbsp;his face or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was just the lighting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd1/df1/d0710e509d85caddfb594116f6.jpg><p>Some people were genuinely worried, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> things like, “What did he&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;his face?” Others were just plain shocked, asking, “Did he&nbsp;mess with his face?” And there were those who noticed a&nbsp;change, saying, “Yeah, he&nbsp;does look a&nbsp;bit different.”</p><p>“The filler scares me...put the syringe down my&nbsp;man,” someone wrote in&nbsp;the comment sections, while another noticed, “<a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> and fillers...men do&nbsp;it&nbsp;too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d7/6f2/a1d6325fc38e15a6506b729d88.jpg><p>“He&nbsp;messed his face up&nbsp;with all those fillers a&nbsp;while ago,” another person commented, hinting that Lionel might have been getting cosmetic work done for a&nbsp;while. This caught many off guard, especially since the country singer had previously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a> he&nbsp;never touched his face. So, seeing him look different now left a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people shocked.</p><p>It’s possible he&nbsp;did something to&nbsp;his face, but what’s clear here is&nbsp;that the famous celeb is&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>, especially for his <a href=#>girlfriend</a>, who’s 40&nbsp;years younger than him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYyfoKWklad6tK%2FAq5ysZZ2aeq21zqecpWWinrCptcSsZJygkaO0prCMn5icnV2owaq%2B0mabnpqRqbJuu82loKedXW1%2BenyYcGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
