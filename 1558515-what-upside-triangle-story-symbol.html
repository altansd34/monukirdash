The tattoo often symbolises the bearer’s membership of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/90c5ee3a92f54ae1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does mid mean on social media and is it an insult?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, the tattoo doesn’t have to mean that one is a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
