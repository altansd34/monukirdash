One day literally changed the whole world for the baby and her future mom.
Nurse Liz Smith believed that being almost 40, she had an extremely small chance to have a baby."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tried</a> IVF (in&nbsp;vitro fertilization) and other methods of&nbsp;getting pregnant, but found out that her lab results prevented her from being a&nbsp;candidate. “That was a&nbsp;bad day,” Smith said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>Then, one day, she met a&nbsp;tiny baby at&nbsp;Franciscan Children’s Hospital, where she worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior director of&nbsp;nursing. The baby girl was born prematurely at&nbsp;29&nbsp;weeks and her weight was just 1&nbsp;pound and 14&nbsp;ounces. The baby named Gisele came into the world with a&nbsp;severe diagnosis as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the bad habits her biological mom had throughout her pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a6d/442/1596fa5270b2dfc61a8f6b283a.jpg><p>The tiny girl had already been in&nbsp;the hospital for 5&nbsp;months by&nbsp;the time Liz Smith spotted her being wheeled down the hall by&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse. And that was the moment when the woman started feeling overwhelming love for the baby.</p><p>“Who’s this beautiful angel?” Liz <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> the nurse who was wheeling the baby. “Her name is&nbsp;Gisele,” the nurse replied. Then she learned that the baby was brought to&nbsp;her hospital because her lungs needed specialized care, and the child had been using a&nbsp;feeding tube. Gisele was all alone and did not have a&nbsp;single visitor during the entire months she had stayed at&nbsp;the hospital.</p><p><h2>Since their paths crossed, the 2&nbsp;became inseparable.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/155/479/bb656a5363a129f160793e5523.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de8/01d/3903c55f049ebd9f0132a7dd78.jpg><p>Liz was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> many times by&nbsp;the staff of&nbsp;the hospital that she and the baby were the perfect pair. Before meeting Gisele, the woman had never considered fostering or&nbsp;adoption, but the tiny girl literally turned her inner world upside down.</p><p>The duo instantly bonded, and Smith began visiting Gisele very often. The little girl had suffered from some complications, and Liz was always by&nbsp;her side. “I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;see her every day,” the woman said. “<strong>It&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;my&nbsp;reward after a&nbsp;long workday</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb5/e8e/a54852514da5ba47d1518ff8b5.jpg><p>Initially, Liz fostered Gisele and wanted to&nbsp;reunite the girl with her birth parents. At&nbsp;first, the parents visited their biological daughter, but these visits became fewer and fewer and then stopped completely. Liz’s aim then changed to&nbsp;adopting Gisele.</p><p>“I&nbsp;remember certain nights, one in&nbsp;particular, when she was hooked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the feed, and&nbsp;I was walking by&nbsp;the mirror and the thought went into my&nbsp;head of&nbsp;losing her,” the woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;there in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind because it&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;reality, but it&nbsp;made me&nbsp;sick to&nbsp;my&nbsp;stomach. You can’t just love a&nbsp;certain percentage. You have to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;your all.”</p><p><h2>Adoption was psychologically hard for the woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d72/0b5/7a208257aba884ebabd21c7b4d.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab9/af8/7b10ed51f1b8b0decb2168a7fa.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/125/c95/7d54495d888fb9cd080fb96925.jpg><p>The adoption process started, and the woman had to&nbsp;face some hesitations. The girl’s biological parents did not claim the rights to&nbsp;their baby, and there were no&nbsp;other biological relatives fit to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her. While Liz was relieved to&nbsp;realize Gisele would be&nbsp;well cared for, she was sad about the baby’s parents.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was gaining her, but they were losing her. And to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;battle addiction and being a&nbsp;mom, that’s impossible,” Liz <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Gisele was 2&nbsp;years old when she and her adopted mom finally shared a&nbsp;last name. Liz quickly adapted from being a&nbsp;nurse to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;mom&nbsp;— and Gisele went from a&nbsp;weak preemie to&nbsp;a&nbsp;shining little star. And now, they’ll have each other’s love for the rest of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p>How do&nbsp;you feel about this adoption story?
