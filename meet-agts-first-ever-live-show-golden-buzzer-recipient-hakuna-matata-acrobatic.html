On Tuesday night, America saw Golden Buzzer recipients Liv Warfield and Richard Goodall, alongside other popular acts like BGT Shadow group Attraction Juniors, Roni Sagi and Rhythm, and more. In case you missed it, Hakuna Matata Acrobatic earned the honor of being the first ever Golden Buzzer in the AGT live shows.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-hakuna-matata-acrobatic>Who is Hakuna Matata Acrobatic?</h2><p>Hakuna Matata Acrobatic is a group from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The group chose to take their chances on America’s Got Talent due to the success of AGT Fantasy League winner, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramadhani Brothers</a>. In preparation for the show, the group trained for six days a week for a whole year. Their time on AGT marks the first time they’ve ever performed in front of a live studio audience. In addition, this is the group’s first time in America.</p><p>The group, that consists of full-time acrobats, began their Instagram in December 2023. At that time, they were already performing at live in Afrika Afrika super Cirque show in Austria. According to the Ramadhani Brothers’ TikTok page, they were performing in the same show in November 2023.</p><p>According to Hakuna Matata Acrobatics’ Instagram bio, they are currently contestants on AGT, Česko Slovensko má talent (Slovakia’s Got Talent), Got Talent España (Spain’s Got Talent), Tú Sí Que Vales (Italy’s Got Talent), and La France a Un Incroyable Talent (France’s Got Talent). Their performance videos have been shared by African Artiste Management on YouTube. For those who may not know, this channel is run by Winston Ruddle. Ruddle is the Ramadhani Brothers’ manager, so it’s possible Ruddle also manages Hakuna Matata Acrobatic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-presses-the-first-ever-live-show-golden-buzzer-for-hakuna-matata-acrobatic>Sofia Vergara Presses The First Ever Live Show Golden Buzzer for Hakuna Matata Acrobatic</h2><p>During AGT’s first live show episode, Sofia Vergara had the Golden Buzzer pick of the night. The lineup began with Flewnt and Inkabee, followed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liv Warfield</a>, Attraction Junior, Hyper Kids Africa, Ashes and Arrows, and Los Ojos High School.</p><p>Hakuna Matata Acrobatic started their act with four members. Three of the members held up a platform, while the other member set up a rolly-polly apparatus on the platform. Then, the group showed off their strength by having two members hold the other two up while on top of a rolly polly. The top two members held on to each other similar to the Ramadhani Brothers (one upside down, balancing on the others’ head).</p><p>After, they amped up their performance by starting on a high platform, and adding more rolly polly apparatuses. This time, they individually climbed the person on the bottom, until all four members were off the ground. Once again the member on top balanced on the others head. This time, using only one hand.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>After the performance, all of the judges were seen giving the group a standing ovation. When it was Sofia’s turn to comment on the act, she said “this is definitely once of the most ambitious acts I’ve seen on AGT.” She then stood up and hit the Golden Buzzer for them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-else-did-vergara-say-about-them>What Else Did Vergara Say About Them?</h2><p>Following the episode, Vergara walked the red carpet. While on the carpet, she spoke to various reporters about Hakuna Matata Acrobatic.</p><p>“I think those guys deserve it, they have such a hard life and they’ve worked so hard and if I could give them a little push tonight I thought this was the right thing to do,” Sofia Vergara said while talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">THE BUZZ</a>. “They’re so good, they’re so fearless and they didn’t miss one bit and what they’re doing was not easy, so I thought you know what? They deserve it.”</p><p>What did you think of AGT’s first live show Golden Buzzer? Do you think Sofia Vergara made the right choice?
