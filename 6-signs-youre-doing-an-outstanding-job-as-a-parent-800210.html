Here are some of&nbsp;the signs that you’re doing a&nbsp;great job parenting, that can help improve your relationship with your kids and make them better people.</p><p><h2>1. You instill 2-way communication.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3cd/653/cc46115d38a8ebe0963b5cde39.png><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>researchers</a> at&nbsp;MIT and Harvard, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;crucial for parents to&nbsp;have back and forth <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> with their children. One of&nbsp;the simplest, but most meaningful ways to&nbsp;start this communication is&nbsp;to&nbsp;look your child directly in&nbsp;the eyes when you talk to&nbsp;them and when they talk to&nbsp;you. This gives your child a&nbsp;sense that you are readily listening to&nbsp;them, while at&nbsp;the same time gives them the motivation to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>2. You are humble enough to&nbsp;apologize.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9fb/fad/dab4345086abeb81740a028b43.png><p>Naturally, arguments and fights can occur between you and your child, and both of&nbsp;you might be&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;playing the victim. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>important</a> for parents to&nbsp;understand when it&nbsp;is&nbsp;their turn to&nbsp;apologize. Although it&nbsp;may come off as&nbsp;difficult for you in&nbsp;the start, knowing how to&nbsp;own up&nbsp;to&nbsp;your mistakes and explain why you were at&nbsp;fault not only teaches your child sincerity and openness, but invites them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same when they make mistakes.</p><p><h2>3. You dream with your child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2f/005/6fbc735168a64496369f0846ee.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;Walt Disney’s most powerful messages goes, “If&nbsp;you can dream&nbsp;it, you can do&nbsp;it.” As&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;encourage your children to&nbsp;dream and to&nbsp;have ambition. But even more important is&nbsp;to&nbsp;show your support for their talents and hobbies, and help them reach their goals. <a href=#>Studies</a> show that supportive parents are a&nbsp;major factor in&nbsp;the future success of&nbsp;their children.</p><p><h2>4. You maintain schedules.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c8/6aa/a2691f5ee691dafe6900b074ef.jpg><p>Knowing what will happen in&nbsp;their day gives your child a&nbsp;<a href=#>sense</a> of&nbsp;safety, confidence, and control. Implementing schedules for your children at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age with things like mealtimes, pick-ups from school or&nbsp;daycare, naptime, and bedtime, builds <a href=#>trust</a> between you and your child, so&nbsp;they know what to&nbsp;expect and when to&nbsp;expect you. In&nbsp;older children, a&nbsp;routine <a href=#>instills</a> <a href=# title=discipline data-link=tag>discipline</a> and structure in&nbsp;their lives, which in&nbsp;the long run teaches them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more <a href=#>independent</a> and accountable for their tasks. <a href=#>Studies</a> show that having meals together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family makes children happier and teaches them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;better communicators.</p><p><h2>5. You live up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;first teacher.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fd/c37/a0b89453f3a2adc803bdcb0900.jpg><p>A&nbsp;parent is&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s first teacher. From <a href=#>teaching</a> their children their first words to&nbsp;developing good habits and learning about their surroundings, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent’s job to&nbsp;not only raise them, but to&nbsp;teach them. Reading books before bedtime or&nbsp;having fun during playtime not only <a href=#>enriches</a> your children’s lives and experiences, but it&nbsp;allows you to&nbsp;devote quality time to&nbsp;them, allowing them to&nbsp;feel your love, time, and care. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;also good to&nbsp;give your child <a href=#>constructive feedback</a> when they misbehave, so&nbsp;that they understand when they are wrong. This will help them make up&nbsp;their minds to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and become better people.</p><p><h2>6. You know when to&nbsp;stand behind your child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dce/668/1ef521555b9cf13be6dda0dd72.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the duty of&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent to&nbsp;protect and provide for their children, but being overprotective and always giving in&nbsp;to&nbsp;your child’s wants can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager and adult with a&nbsp;bad disposition. <a href=#>Studies</a> show that overprotective parenting encourages children to&nbsp;lie, become manipulative, and be&nbsp;fearful of&nbsp;taking on&nbsp;risks and new experiences. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;important for parents to&nbsp;gauge when they should take a&nbsp;step back and allow their child to&nbsp;make their own decisions, take action, and figure things out on&nbsp;their own. However, you must also remember to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there during their failures and help them figure out what went wrong and how they can do&nbsp;better next time.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you believe that parenting makes a&nbsp;big impact on&nbsp;children when they become adults?
