While this score has decreased since the Government allowed restaurants to reopen on July 4th, it remains higher than before the pandemic.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/CityAM20JE.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Over two months of lockdown, Just Eat’s Purchase Intent scores (whether a brand is someone’s first choice to purchase from) also rose from 7.1 to a peak of 12.8 (May 23rd), while Value scores (a net measure of whether consumers think the brand represents good or poor value for money) doubled from 2.9 to 7.1. (May 3rd).</p><p>Consideration scores (whether someone would consider purchasing from the brand in future) increased from 16.3 to 22.0 (May 20th) and Satisfaction scores (whether someone is a satisfied or dissatisfied customer) increased from 12.3 to 16.8 (May 23rd).</p><p>Just Eat has held on to some of these gains since restaurants reopened. Overall Index scores were at 7.4 by August 21st, and while Purchase Intent has also fallen from its peak, it hit 8.6 on the same day; higher than the beginning of lockdown. Across some metrics, customer opinion has even improved: Quality scores (a net measure of whether consumers think the brand represents good or poor quality) rose from 1.8 (March 23rd) to 5.3 (August 2nd).</p><p>If closing restaurants during lockdown made delivery apps more attractive to customers, it also gave them fewer options to choose from. As an older business with a more mature infrastructure and wider coverage across the UK, Just Eat may have been well-placed to benefit from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p><strong>This article previously appeared in City A.M.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2aCen6Mo6ysrF2arrV505qinqtdl7a1sYyorK1llqS8pXnDnqOirpWnxm65wKuinqxdmcKztc0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
