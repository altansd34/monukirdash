She lived a&nbsp;normal peaceful childhood and nothing extraordinary happened in&nbsp;her life. An&nbsp;apple didn’t hit her head and she didn’t scream “Eureka!” She was just a&nbsp;normal kid when something happened<strong> that later changed her life.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d2/2e7/079d2355d28dcf2f2e93e2f112.jpg><p>Savant had her first&nbsp;IQ <a href=#>test</a> in&nbsp;September of&nbsp;1956 when she was just 10&nbsp;years old. <strong>Her mental age was 22&nbsp;years and 10&nbsp;months</strong> and her general score was 228. For comparison, the <a href=#>average</a>&nbsp;IQ score of&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal person is&nbsp;between 85&nbsp;and 115.</p><p>Although it&nbsp;turned out that Marilyn had an&nbsp;extraordinary brain, her <a href=#>parents</a> decided to&nbsp;hide this information from the public in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;assure her a&nbsp;normal childhood.</p><p><h2>Finally, society found out that she was one of&nbsp;the smartest people in&nbsp;the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/896/575/70d6955353959788d912630ec7.jpg><p>When Savant became older she continued her studies, but she felt bored and <a href=#>left</a> Washington University after 2&nbsp;years. Marilyn started to&nbsp;build her career in&nbsp;stocks and real estate. Despite this, her real passion was writing. She used her personal investments to&nbsp;allow herself to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;full-time writer. But even then, Savant wrote <strong>novels and short stories under a&nbsp;pseudonym</strong> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;stay out of&nbsp;the spotlight.</p><p><strong>The year <a href=#>1988</a> changed her life</strong>. Her unbelievably high&nbsp;IQ level of&nbsp;228 was listed in&nbsp;the Guinness Book of&nbsp;World Records Hall of&nbsp;Fame. Suddenly, Savant became a&nbsp;celebrity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dc0/9cf/b80bfa548e9c53a58fefcb0b47.png><p>Interviews and&nbsp;TV shows entered her life, but Savant didn’t let that go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her head: “<strong><a href=#>We</a>&nbsp;only use something like 10&nbsp;percent of&nbsp;our brain,</strong> anywhere between 5&nbsp;and 15&nbsp;percent.” In&nbsp;her opinion, people are capable of&nbsp;extraordinary things. Just some people can use “<a href=#>17.7</a> percent of&nbsp;their brain” and others “17.8&nbsp;percent.”</p><p>Savant’s personality became attractive to&nbsp;the public and she was even featured in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>episode</a> of&nbsp;The Simpsons in&nbsp;1999.</p><p><h2>To&nbsp;her detractors, she is&nbsp;someone who has squandered her gift of&nbsp;genius.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bce/462/6a91d652178ba4aff65f470965.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;wife, a&nbsp;mother, and a&nbsp;successful columnist, her life seemed too normal. In&nbsp;1987, she <a href=#>married</a> Robert K. Jarvik, the surgeon who developed the mechanical artificial human heart. But her detractors kept saying that the path she chose in&nbsp;life was too trivial and that she wasn’t using her talent. She got <a href=#>angry</a> messages and people even speculated that maybe she was not a&nbsp;genius.</p><p>In&nbsp;her interview, she says that<strong>&nbsp;IQ is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;“<a href=#>capacity</a>” of&nbsp;how you use your intelligence.</strong> She is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;calculator, but a&nbsp;normal human being: “<a href=#>Everyone</a> has the capacity to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;least an&nbsp;Einstein.”</p><p>Despite all the talk about her, Marilyn thinks that she is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the right path: “<a href=#>Society</a> offers&nbsp;us so&nbsp;much. I&nbsp;don’t think we&nbsp;do&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;give back, but&nbsp;I think we&nbsp;all bear a&nbsp;social responsibility and&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I bear one too. And I&nbsp;rather think that <strong>writing is&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent way to&nbsp;give back to&nbsp;people what they have given to&nbsp;me</strong>.”</p><p>Savant sets a&nbsp;good example that intelligent people are not always the ones taking the lead in&nbsp;this world and that’s also&nbsp;OK because we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what actually suits&nbsp;us.</p><p>We&nbsp;hope everyone finds their own way in&nbsp;life and feels happy!</p><p><h2>Bonus: Check the IQs of&nbsp;the great minds of&nbsp;today, like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a0/f88/93c75a52f4a45d3c97a9f5562b.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>specialists</a>, <strong>Steve Jobs</strong> likely had an&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;roughly 160&nbsp;or above. This means that he&nbsp;was conventionally smarter than about 6,839,822,949 people on&nbsp;earth.</p><p><strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> IQ&nbsp;is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=#>155</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=# title="Mark Zuckerberg" data-link=tag>Mark Zuckerberg</a>’s</strong> IQ&nbsp;is&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=#>152</a>, which is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the top 0.1% of&nbsp;the population in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>What’s your opinion about&nbsp;IQ tests?
