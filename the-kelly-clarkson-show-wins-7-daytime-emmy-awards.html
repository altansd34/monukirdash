They won seven of their nine Daytime Emmy Award nominations. For the third year in a row, Clarkson has been named as Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show host.</strong></p><p>The Kelly Clarkson Show was one of the top winners at the 49th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. The talk show came to the event with nine nominations and left with seven awards. These awards recognize the show for their lighting direction, technical team (camera work/video), multiple camera editing, live sound mixing and editing, art direction/set decoration/scenic design, and host. The show also won best in it’s overall entertainment talk show category.</p><p>The Kelly Clarkson Show was among the shows that won the most awards on Friday night. The overall top winner of the night was General Hospital, which won five awards and became the drama series to win the most Daytime Emmy Awards in history with 15. After this ceremony, The Kelly Clarkson Show has won a total of 13 Daytime Emmy Awards since their 2019 debut.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-kelly-clarkson-show-celebrates-their-daytime-emmy-awards>The Kelly Clarkson Show Celebrates Their Daytime Emmy Awards</h2><p>On June 25, The Kelly Clarkson Show took to Instagram to celebrate their wins. They shared two graphics, one stating each award they won, while the other features Clarkson herself as the winner of outstanding entertainment talk show host.</p><p>“Cue the air horn! Thank you Daytime Emmys! Congratulations to our entire staff and crew, and our incredible host Kelly Clarkson, on their #DaytimeEmmys wins,” they wrote.</p><p>Clarkson hasn’t shared her win on her individual social media at this time. Clarkson’s individual Emmy Award count is at a running total of five since her show’s 2019 release. In this case, Clarkson is recognized individually for both outstanding entertainment talk show and talk show host. To <a href=#>compare</a>, Clarkson has won three Grammy Awards in her lengthy music career. Since the Daytime Emmy nominations came in while filming, fans expect Clarkson to comment on their win behind the scenes once again.</p><p>On May 6, The Kelly Clarkson Show posted the host <a href=#>reacting</a> to their nominations. Clarkson appeared to be in disbelief of their nominations when being told about them on set. She was jaw dropped, stating “oh my god! It’s our whole show!”</p><p>Within the video, the talk show host got out of her chair and congratulated her in-studio band for their nomination. Clarkson ran over to her music director, Jason Halbert and gave him a huge hug. It’s sad to say that this group has lost the category, but there’s always next year.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/161307_9894-1.jpg alt="Is Len Goodman Leaving ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Next Season?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqOVobm6ecKlmKujo6S7br%2FHqK5mr5mjwG6DjJ2YsqyZorJuscymsGaZp5a%2Fpb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
