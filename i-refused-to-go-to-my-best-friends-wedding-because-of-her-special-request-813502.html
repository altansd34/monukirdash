Of&nbsp;course, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, my&nbsp;<a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> changed. We&nbsp;could no&nbsp;longer spend all our time together or&nbsp;stay up&nbsp;all night partying because&nbsp;I had other responsibilities now. Nor could we&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip with them anytime they wanted because my&nbsp;little boy had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;kindergarten. And Sara didn’t like that. I&nbsp;felt she didn’t understand my&nbsp;new role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother. I&nbsp;still loved her and wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;spend time together, but&nbsp;I also love my&nbsp;son; he&nbsp;is&nbsp;my&nbsp;number one priority.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdc/745/3bcd815184982cb05ab122cf89.jpg><p>However, she did not agree with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;personal decisions, constantly criticizing me&nbsp;and telling me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I had become a&nbsp;“boring and careless” housemother who only thought about her husband and son. These negative comments, plus her lack of&nbsp;understanding, caused&nbsp;us to&nbsp;drift apart. We&nbsp;saw each other occasionally, but&nbsp;I felt things were not how they used to&nbsp;be. However, we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;good time when we&nbsp;were together, like in&nbsp;the old days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/775/a34/e3b7e458939d30dcb15bdd2263.jpg><p>I&nbsp;immediately texted her back, telling her, “Sara, my&nbsp;friend, I’m so&nbsp;sorry about this whole situation, but I’m not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;your wedding.” My&nbsp;words were an&nbsp;explosive bombshell for her since&nbsp;I was her maid of&nbsp;honor. Sara first asked me&nbsp;why and if&nbsp;I was joking with her. I&nbsp;explained to&nbsp;her that the invitation said no&nbsp;children were allowed and that if&nbsp;my&nbsp;little ones were not welcome, neither was I.&nbsp;She started insulting me&nbsp;and saying very nasty things to&nbsp;me. Her words were very hurtful and in&nbsp;terrible taste. I&nbsp;told her not to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;personally and explained that if&nbsp;she could not accept my&nbsp;children, it&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she didn’t accept&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/505/727/d8f0ad5d419611eb68baf5689f.jpg><p>The last words she said to&nbsp;me&nbsp;were: “I&nbsp;think you should respect my&nbsp;decision not to&nbsp;have kids at&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding, it’s my&nbsp;special day, and I’m going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what I&nbsp;want. Besides, it’s not a&nbsp;big deal and shouldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem. Weddings are unsuitable for kids, and&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;see them running around. This <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> is&nbsp;pointless if<a href=#>&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part</a> of&nbsp;it. You’re not right in&nbsp;the head and should seek help.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdd/a2e/76c0e75898b8e6e7e69e248cfa.jpg><p>The bride should have made it clear to you at the time she asked you to be maid of honor and to plan the wedding that children aren't allowed. If that had been made clear from the get go, likely the relationship could have been saved.</p><p><h2>Pros and cons of&nbsp;bringing children to&nbsp;weddings</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b5/776/fae68a59c9bf2ec1141c8fe0be.jpg><p>Some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>advantages</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>You are including all family members: </strong>Inviting children allows all family members to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present. Also, if&nbsp;the event is&nbsp;open to&nbsp;children, the parents will most likely appreciate the gesture. Some of&nbsp;the children’s best memories come from attending weddings at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. Without knowing&nbsp;it, you could be&nbsp;making a&nbsp;positive impression on&nbsp;them about love and commitment.</li><li><strong>Guests won’t have to&nbsp;worry about finding childcare: </strong>Being a&nbsp;parent is&nbsp;hard work, and sometimes leaving your child, even overnight, comes with guilt or&nbsp;constant worry about whether they’ll be&nbsp;okay with the babysitter. Finding reliable childcare can be&nbsp;difficult, and allowing guests to&nbsp;bring their children will avoid the stress that comes with&nbsp;it. They’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;deep breath and enjoy the evening knowing their child is&nbsp;safe with them.</li><li><strong>Unexpected funny moments: </strong>They may steal the spotlight from you, but their joy, unexpected funny behavior, and tenderness will melt your heart. They can also participate by&nbsp;scattering the flower petals as&nbsp;they walk down the aisle or&nbsp;be&nbsp;the ring bearers. The little ones can help hold the wedding dress as&nbsp;they walk down the aisle.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/317/122/00e9c85a2cb86f50a728629cdb.jpg><p>Certain couples choose to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;wedding without children for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>variety of&nbsp;reasons</a>, including:</p><ul><li><strong>More adult atmosphere:</strong> Some couples prefer to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;more formal atmosphere for their wedding. This may include music, activities, or&nbsp;themes inappropriate for young children.</li><li><strong>Space limitations:</strong> Wedding venues often have limited capacity, making it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;accommodate children and adult guests. In&nbsp;such cases, the bride and groom may decide not to&nbsp;invite children to&nbsp;ensure that all adult guests have sufficient seating and space.</li><li><strong>Budgetary considerations:</strong> Weddings can be&nbsp;expensive, and some couples may have budget constraints that prevent them from inviting additional guests. By&nbsp;eliminating children from the guest list, they can reduce food, seating, and child-specific entertainment costs.</li><li><strong>Simpler planning:</strong> The presence of&nbsp;children may require additional planning, such as&nbsp;providing age-appropriate activities, caregivers, or&nbsp;designated areas for them. By&nbsp;having a&nbsp;child-free wedding, the bride and groom can simplify the logistics and planning process.</li><li><strong>Bride and groom’s decision:</strong> While some may be&nbsp;disappointed or&nbsp;upset about not being able to&nbsp;bring their children to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;remember that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the bride and groom’s decision. Respecting their choice and enjoying the celebration is&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;show consideration and understanding for them.</li></ul><p><h2>Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;rude not to&nbsp;allow parents to&nbsp;bring their children to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db9/254/0474f254ef82c045cb0ceeac7f.jpg><p>Are your children so young that you breastfeed them? if not then what is the problem? They need their mother all the time, please so extraordinarily silly. Couldn't your mother or another adult you know babysit that day? The cubs would probably have coped without you, but with another adult just fine.<br>What would you do if you ended up in the hospital? You can't have your kids there, have you thought that far?<br>Surely the children have a father who can put up a little or do you not let him do anything with them because you think you are the only person in the whole universe who can take care of the children?<br>I don't understand the parents who insist on always dragging their children with them to all the parties etc. There are babysitters available and what should you do to ensure that they get social skills when they grow up and need to spend time with children of the same age. .. should you deny them this because you don't want to let go of them? Children need to meet other adults etc. and not be so dependent on mother.</p><p>Whether or&nbsp;not to&nbsp;invite children to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding is&nbsp;completely personal and depends on&nbsp;the bride and groom’s preferences. Some couples choose to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;adults-only wedding, while others may include children in&nbsp;the celebration.</p><p>Respecting the bride and groom’s choice regarding children’s attendance at&nbsp;their wedding is&nbsp;important. If&nbsp;only adults have been invited, respecting that decision and not bringing children without prior authorization is&nbsp;appropriate. If&nbsp;nothing is&nbsp;mentioned in&nbsp;the invitation about children attending, you can politely ask the bride and groom if&nbsp;children are included on&nbsp;the guest list. Ultimately, <a href=#>planning a&nbsp;wedding</a> is&nbsp;the responsibility of&nbsp;the bride and groom. As<a href=#>&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest</a>, you are expected to&nbsp;respect their decisions and enjoy the celebration according to&nbsp;the established conditions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuvsSfrKydlGLBsHnGqGStp12ixm6uxKyrZp6inrKvsNJmrp6clJ67qHnBnpqaraOaerCyjKGcq2WjpbKktcClZKudoaqytMCMcWhsbWBnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
