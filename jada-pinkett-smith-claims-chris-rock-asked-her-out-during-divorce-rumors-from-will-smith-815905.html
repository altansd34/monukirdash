Before the Oscars incident, Chris Rock asked Jada out on a date.
The actress responded, “I mean, that’s what comedians do. I would just have to say that I am not really here to make any judgment on how people decide to express themselves and express their art."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’ve had my&nbsp;feelings hurt a&nbsp;lot by&nbsp;Chris.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d2/cb5/318bed5abd99148784f5eee8bc.jpg><p>Jada further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledged</a> that they were living apart when the incident occurred at&nbsp;the 94th Academy Awards in&nbsp;2022, where her husband confronted comedian Chris Rock on&nbsp;stage. The startling altercation happened just moments before Will won the Best Actor award. In&nbsp;his acceptance speech, a&nbsp;tearful Smith <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that “love makes you do&nbsp;crazy things” but notably failed to&nbsp;apologize to&nbsp;Chris for the confrontation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77d/a09/fe5e8e561d93e925883979af65.jpg><p>Surprisingly, Jada <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discloses</a> in&nbsp;her book that Chris once asked her out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date, she recalled, “I&nbsp;think every summer all the reports would come out that me&nbsp;and Will were getting a&nbsp;divorce. And this particular summer, Chris, he&nbsp;thought that we&nbsp;were getting a&nbsp;divorce. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;called&nbsp;me, and basically, he&nbsp;was like, ‘I’d love to&nbsp;take you out.’ And I&nbsp;was like, ‘What do&nbsp;you mean?’ He&nbsp;was like, ‘Well, aren’t you and Will getting a&nbsp;divorce?’ I&nbsp;was like, ‘No. Chris, those are just rumors.’ He&nbsp;was appalled. And he&nbsp;profusely apologized, and that was that.”</p><p>Jada Pinkett Smith and Chris Rock haven’t<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> communicated</a> since the Oscars incident, but she hopes everyone involved can find “peace.”</p><p><h2>The course of&nbsp;her future with Will is&nbsp;now uncertain.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b21/93f/692a6d5d5381a15d9656f015a7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate interview, the 52-year-old actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about an&nbsp;issue that has been kept secret until now. The news came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprising revelation, especially considering her and <a href=# title="Will Smith" data-link=tag>Will Smith</a>’s prior denials of&nbsp;marital complications and their outward portrayal of&nbsp;a&nbsp;committed married couple.</p><p>Jada <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disclosed</a> that she and her husband, Will Smith, have quietly lived apart for the past 7&nbsp;years. They initially married in&nbsp;1997 and are currently navigating the uncertain path of&nbsp;their future together.<br>During the talk show, Jada shared insights into her relationship breakdown with Will Smith. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “By&nbsp;the time we&nbsp;got to&nbsp;2016, we&nbsp;were just exhausted with trying. I&nbsp;think we&nbsp;were both still stuck in&nbsp;our fantasy of&nbsp;what we&nbsp;thought the other person should&nbsp;be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/e71/037a115f30a5099695a0d72066.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her book, the actress likened their separation to&nbsp;a ’divorce,’ even though no&nbsp;legal paperwork had been filed. Jada wrote, “It&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;divorce on&nbsp;paper. But it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;divorce.” She openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discussed</a> her considerations regarding a&nbsp;legal divorce in&nbsp;the interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a07/64d/a1b62e56dda1117fb794ac4db1.jpg><p>The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that she had contemplated it&nbsp;but ultimately couldn’t bring herself to&nbsp;follow through. She candidly revealed that she had made a ’promise’ to&nbsp;her husband, vowing never to&nbsp;provide him with a ’reason’ for divorce. This commitment played a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;her decision-making process.</p><p>“I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;promise that there will never be&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;divorce... We&nbsp;will work through whatever. And I&nbsp;just haven’t been able to&nbsp;break that promise,” the actress confirmed during the interview. When asked, “But you still live separately?” Jada responded with a&nbsp;straightforward affirmation, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “We&nbsp;live separately.”</p><p><h2>Jada has had an&nbsp;affair, and admitted it&nbsp;publicly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cf7/df4/6e80915f06bec577e985001d6d.png><p>Additionally, in&nbsp;July 2020, Jada publicly admitted having had an&nbsp;affair with the 31-year-old singer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>August Alsina</a>, during her marriage to&nbsp;Will. This revelation came during a&nbsp;candid confession on&nbsp;her Facebook show, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Red Table Talk</a>, where she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disclosed</a> that she had developed a&nbsp;friendship with August four years prior. She also noted that she and Will were going through a ’difficult time’ and had ’basically broken up’ at&nbsp;that point.</p><p>Jada’s description of&nbsp;the affair famously referred to&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an ’entanglement,’ a&nbsp;term that has since found its way into August’s track, ’Shake the World.’ This startling revelation <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>came</a> after both actors initially denied August’s claims that Will had given his blessing for a&nbsp;relationship between August and Jada.</p><p><h2>She detailed her mental struggles in&nbsp;her new autobiography.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fed/771/1050e051c7a346ed4513d71d1c.jpg><p>This recent interview has made quite an&nbsp;impact during Jada’s ongoing promotional tour for her new book. Her book bravely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discusses</a> various challenging topics, including her battle with ’depression’ and ’despair,’ which began around 40.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reflects</a>, “On&nbsp;paper, it&nbsp;all looked grand&nbsp;— I&nbsp;had the beautiful family, the superstar husband, the lavish lifestyle, fame, and fortune.” However, she reveals that behind the scenes, “I’d fallen into despair and wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;this earth less and less.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/68e/50a/0b0d55510db3745e29ec65ec62.png><p>In&nbsp;her autobiography, Jada <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reveals</a> that it&nbsp;wasn’t until adulthood that she understood the extent of&nbsp;her suffering, diagnosing herself with ’complex trauma with PTSD and dissociation.’ However, during her most trying times around her 40th birthday, she hadn’t received an&nbsp;official diagnosis and grappled with her trauma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6bb/915/12ef495bd38d714f28405dd2c4.png><p>The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discloses</a> that for 2&nbsp;decades, she had put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;façade, appearing fine to&nbsp;the world while struggling with bouts of&nbsp;profound hopelessness. She felt undeserving of&nbsp;love, which only added to&nbsp;the disconnect between the seemingly perfect life she had achieved and the deep sense of&nbsp;loss she carried with her.</p><p>She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledges</a> that therapy had limits, helping her reach 40&nbsp;but leaving her searching for more. Her source of&nbsp;solace during these trying times was her children. However, even their support was not enough to&nbsp;quell the inner turmoil she was experiencing.</p><p><h2>She considers her children as&nbsp;her little supporters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f34/189/1016f956d4867e86e986c62151.jpg><p>Jada also expressed her admiration for her children&nbsp;— Jaden, 25, Willow, 22, and Trey, 30, who is&nbsp;Will’s son from a&nbsp;previous relationship&nbsp;— for supporting her during this challenging period in&nbsp;her relationship. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “My&nbsp;children, they’re little gurus. They’ve taught me&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep sense of&nbsp;self-acceptance. They love every part of&nbsp;me.”</p><p>And here’s Jada’s <a href=#>story</a> showing that a&nbsp;stepchild can be&nbsp;the purest act of&nbsp;love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLeisMBmp6Kmm5rBtXnSpqCtoF2YuaK1zKxknKCinsBuvs6comaZo6CypXnHnqlmp6WpeqXB0aKloGWUnsOwvsKeZKutnaS%2FtHnFq6amZaeeua150qagraBdbX52hY9uZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
