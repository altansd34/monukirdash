His early life was filled with hurdles.
The Venom and Peaky Blinders actor experienced homelessness and struggled with mental health challenges at a very young age. When he was a 21-year-old, and in dire need of money, Hardy entered a modeling contest in which he won, leading to the opening of several doors into the world of acting."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;21-year-old, and in&nbsp;dire need of&nbsp;money, Hardy entered a&nbsp;modeling contest in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;won, leading to&nbsp;the opening of&nbsp;several doors into the world of&nbsp;acting. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Hardy decided to&nbsp;study method acting, which subsequently landed him his first-ever role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Band of&nbsp;Brothers</i></a>.</p><p><h2>The incident that was a&nbsp;turning point</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/132/a7e/942519515784510b1dd8d1d194.jpg><p>His next big <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Black Hawk Down</i></a><i>, </i>which was<i> </i>a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>painful period</a> for Hardy since, while filming&nbsp;it, the actor had a&nbsp;near-death experience after a&nbsp;night of&nbsp;partying. The doctor at&nbsp;the time warned him that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t turn his life around, he&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;around for much longer. With this warning and the support of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and friends, Hardy finally decided to&nbsp;put himself on&nbsp;the path to&nbsp;recovery.</p><h2>Hardy’s first saving grace: His loving wife and kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11f/244/6f2bac5cdfbba70b518f19507e.jpg><p>Tom hasn’t had the best luck in&nbsp;his love life. However, when British actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charlotte Riley</a> stepped into his life when he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;a&nbsp;low point, everything changed for him. The pair first met on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wuthering Heights</i></a>. The 2&nbsp;were at&nbsp;different points in&nbsp;their lives back then, and the actress was skeptical about Hardy. However, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that there was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;chemistry between them and she ended up&nbsp;giving him a&nbsp;chance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b2/3b7/a701e75d0f9cfd1f7720b59cd6.jpg><p>Hardy took this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;true blessing in&nbsp;his life and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that he&nbsp;would wait for her for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;it&nbsp;took. His relationship with the actress was what continuously kept him grounded. Today, the pair are married with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2&nbsp;kids</a>, and Hardy gushes about how much his wife is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;support him and how he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admires</a> her kind and pure spirit.</p><p><h2>Hardy’s second saving grace: His passion for martial arts<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aa6/5f5/b71f3f54e9bb80ad5fffaaf827.png><p>While being a&nbsp;husband and a&nbsp;father remains the main focus in&nbsp;keeping his <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> in&nbsp;check, his passion for martial arts has really helped him <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feel fulfilled</a>. The star first began training for the 2011 movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Warrior</i></a> and has worked his way up&nbsp;ever since. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that this sport has been key to&nbsp;further developing a&nbsp;deeper sense of&nbsp;inner resilience, calm, and well-being while keeping him from falling back into his old habits.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now an&nbsp;avid <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a> practitioner and holds the rank of&nbsp;blue belt (the second rank out of&nbsp;5). He&nbsp;has won a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;competitions, including <i>the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Open Championship,</i> where he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recently</a> won gold. In&nbsp;fact, his humble nature and professionalism were evident in&nbsp;showing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;that tournament.</p><p><h2>Tom Hardy: A&nbsp;goodwill ambassador<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5b/bc6/8b15df503a89309a59e6e08254.jpg><p>Today, the star is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>goodwill ambassador</a>.
