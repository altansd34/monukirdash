This 29-year-old Californian will continue the fight as part of Team Blake in the Live Playoffs. Here’s everything to know about him.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-bodie-before-he-joined-the-voice>Who is Bodie Before He Joined The Voice?</h2><p>At a young age, Bodie started learning instruments varying from clarinet to drums. He continued his passion in music as he grows up, already writing and producing his own songs at 11. However, when he turned 15, he was diagnosed with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss. Such condition made Bodie lose his hair completely, triggering him into a state of anxiety and depression.</p><p>Despite doctors’ forecast, his hair has grown back and fallen out multiple times. Today, he treats music as a creative platform to inspire people who’s having the same experience.</p><p>The Voice is not the first time that Bodie had acquired some level of recognition in music. He has already released two EPs titled Love at First Fight and Me and You. Apart from that, he also dropped singles, “moonlight,” “teenage love,” and “i think i like you.” These three tracks have garnered over a million views each since their release. In June 2022, Bodie released his latest single, “GHOST.”</p><p>Beside singing, he manages his own media company and has produced a documentary this year. He is also a worship leader and an adjunct professor. On top of that, he assumes the ultimate responsibility as a husband and a father of a <a href=# class=broken_link>five-member family</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Made Blake Shelton Fight for Him</h2><p>Since Shelton has appeared on all of the seasons of The Voice, he typically doesn’t have to beg artists to join his team. Bodie’s audition was on another level, so Shelton practically shouted at John Legend for turning his chair. Bodie’s rendition of “You Found Me” by The Fray blew all four coaches away.</p><p>“Everybody is going to remember you, the way you look, the way you sound,” Shelton said. “You have what it takes to make it to the finale of The Voice.”</p><p>Bodie’s time on Team Blake has brought him into the Battle Round against Jaeden Luke, here they sang Justin Bieber’s “As Long As You Love Me.” In the Knockouts, he beat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Hawkins</a> and The Dryes through a rendition of “Better Now” by Post Malone.</p><p>Now, he heads on to the Live Playoffs still as part of Team Blake. If you want to see if Bodie will make it to the Finale, tune in to The Voice on Mondays and Tuesdays on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_Lizzo_Tim-MosenfelderGetty-Images-220x149.jpg alt="Lizzo Shares Trailer for Upcoming HBO Max Documentary ‘Love, Lizzo’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWSpLGqsYytn55lo567qLHRZpmlmZuaerS0xKWrqKZdl7Kos8SdZK2nXZeybrvNZp%2Biq12psqK5jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
