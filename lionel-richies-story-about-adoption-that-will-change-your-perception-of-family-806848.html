But throughout his life, some of&nbsp;Lionel’s sweetest rewards have had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with fatherhood. Today, he&nbsp;has three children: Nicole, Miles, and Sofia. The first to&nbsp;arrive home was Nicole, and she did so&nbsp;under particular circumstances.</p><p>Nicole and Lionel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Prince concert. She was only two years old, and she was on&nbsp;stage, accompanying the other musicians of&nbsp;the show with the tambourine. Richie was touched by&nbsp;the sight of&nbsp;the little girl, and was even more delighted when he&nbsp;met her backstage at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the concert. A&nbsp;few weeks later, when Lionel was visiting some musician friends, he&nbsp;met her again, and then learned that she was going through some hard times.</p><p>At&nbsp;the time, little Nicole’s biological parents, musician Peter Michael Escovedo and Karen Moss, assistant to&nbsp;Prince’s famous drummer Sheila&nbsp;E, had separated and were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unable</a> to&nbsp;spend most of&nbsp;their time with the child, due to&nbsp;their musical tours.</p><p>Also, her mother, who had been caring for her up&nbsp;to&nbsp;that point, was not financially able to&nbsp;support her. “If&nbsp;Nicole stayed there, Karen could earn enough for her future without having to&nbsp;disrupt her daughter’s life,” said Sheila E&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview. So&nbsp;Lionel and his then-wife, Brenda Harvey, offered Nicole’s biological family to&nbsp;give her a&nbsp;place in&nbsp;their home while they settled their affairs.</p><p>Time went by&nbsp;and what began as&nbsp;something temporary, then led the Richie’s to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;definitive decision: they legally adopted the little girl, and she also took their last name. Thus began the paternity stage of&nbsp;Lionel, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> to&nbsp;his own daughter that she turned his world around: she touched his heart at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when he&nbsp;was solely focused on&nbsp;his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>.</p><p>Although Brenda and Lionel divorced some time after adopting Nicole, she continued to&nbsp;count on&nbsp;her father, because Lionel’s decision to&nbsp;adopt came with a&nbsp;promise on&nbsp;his part to&nbsp;the little girl: “I&nbsp;will never leave you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ea/760/97fab753a2a2cf55140220cd4f.jpg><p>Not only did Nicole gain an&nbsp;unconditional father, but after a&nbsp;few years, she also welcomed two siblings. When Lionel remarried to&nbsp;dancer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Diane Alexander</a>, they brought their son Miles into the world, and later their daughter, Sofia. The three siblings have always enjoyed a&nbsp;close relationship and are often seen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sharing</a> moments together, alongside their dad, for whom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fatherhood</a> is&nbsp;“the best job he’s ever had.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/237/54d/2e34e45ac3b4b4b2576b8668d6.jpg><p>Today, when Lionel has even welcomed two grandchildren by&nbsp;his first daughter, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> he&nbsp;feels that “Nicole was a&nbsp;godsend. She was a&nbsp;little girl who needed a&nbsp;chance. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> at&nbsp;me, and I’d say, ’I’m not going anywhere.’”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the best way for a&nbsp;family with adopted children to&nbsp;let them know about their origin?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmqu82eo2aqmZi1qrHSZqqtp6KueqKuzq6rZpmUpL21tc6nZK2gkal6uLXLpWScoJGjtKZ52Kisq2Wgmr%2Bksc%2BtoKimXaSzbrLApqClsV1tfXeEk3Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
