He joined Team Gwen by default, since she was the only coach that turned for him.</p><p>“I don’t know why the whole world wouldn’t turn for that, that was incredible.” Stefani said. “The way you can manipulate your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">voice</a> in these long stretches, it just sours into the next place. I was mesmerized by it. It was so flawless and beautiful.”</p><p>Stefani’s faith in Justin has helped him win against his Battle and Knockout Round partners. The Voice coach was so proud of her singer that she was notably in tears at the thought of eliminating him.</p><p>Justin eventually got picked to move on to the live playoffs, proving he was a level above his fellow singers. Stefani then expressed that she is definitely certain of her decision and that there’s a lot more to expect from Justin.</p><p>“He doesn’t fully realize how gifted he is. He’s so coachable. There’s no way that America’s not going to fall in love with him. We’re just getting started.” Stefani said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Was Justin Aaron Before The Voice?</h2><p>Like many other artists on The Voice, Justin found inspiration through his church. Justin is a Christian that labels himself as a praise and worship leader.</p><p>It’s been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that he was once apart of a band named Justin Aaron and The Royal Priesthood. This group described themself as Justin Aaron and the Royal Priesthood consists of Janice Dowell , Dexter Curry Jr, Kristian Brown and of course I am Justin Aaron. First and foremost we are here to lift the name of Jesus Christ and to share the gospel.”</p><p>At the time of writing, Justin has 2,744 followers on Instagram and 336 followers on Twitter. It’s clear that Justin is truly beginning his career on The Voice, and we can’t wait to see where this journey brings him.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_KiqueGomez_Elizabeth-MorrisNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Who is Team Gwen’s Kique Gomez?
