You did&nbsp;it, you managed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that lucid <a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a> thing, you know, when you’re dreaming, and can suddenly become aware of&nbsp;yourself! You can do&nbsp;anything you want in&nbsp;those dreams, have magical powers, move things with your mind, ride a&nbsp;flying bike, fish while sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small cloud...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/06b/252/fd3d2155f9982d1dc97957de5a.png><p>Awesome. BUT... Yes, unfortunately, there’s a ‘but’. No&nbsp;matter how epic the world of&nbsp;dreams may seem, there are a&nbsp;few things you might want to&nbsp;avoid. You’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house, but you’re not sure if&nbsp;you’re dreaming or&nbsp;not.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;road, a&nbsp;thick <a href=# title=forest data-link=tag>forest</a> behind&nbsp;it, and this house... hmm. The house is&nbsp;old but very neat and clean. Now you’re standing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long hallway. To&nbsp;your left, there’s a&nbsp;beautiful, retro-looking living room. Why not check it&nbsp;out?</p><p>The sunlight’s gently seeping through the curtains, it&nbsp;looks magical: red vintage sofas, a&nbsp;thick green rug, a&nbsp;coffee table, two big bookcases, an&nbsp;old piano in&nbsp;the corner, plants near the windows... Hmm, who waters those if&nbsp;no&nbsp;one lives here? Never mind, hey, check out this standing mirror right next to&nbsp;the piano. Slowly, step by&nbsp;step, you start walking toward&nbsp;it, wondering what you’re going to&nbsp;see...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c80/67b/1cd77b5cd28ab49261ceaab263.png><p>And, stop right there! The first rule of&nbsp;lucid dreaming is&nbsp;to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;avoid doing activities that make you feel too emotional. The mirror might reflect a&nbsp;different and pretty distorted version of&nbsp;yourself. You might not like what you see.</p><p>What if&nbsp;it’s someone else looking back at&nbsp;you, or&nbsp;you realize your hands are unnaturally long, your face is&nbsp;unrecognizable or&nbsp;there’s someone standing behind you? A&nbsp;mirror in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream is&nbsp;definitely the worst way to&nbsp;find that out, so&nbsp;try to&nbsp;resist this temptation. Once you’re a&nbsp;lucid dream pro, you can give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try.</p><p>You move&nbsp;on, checking out other things in&nbsp;the house. Suddenly, a&nbsp;thought pops into your mind. If&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream... Where’s your real body? No, don’t go&nbsp;down that road! Try not to&nbsp;think about your body.</p><p>If&nbsp;you&nbsp;do, you risk losing focus, the house will vanish, and you’ll wake&nbsp;up. Once you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lucid dream, you should try to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;your surroundings. Anything else, especially thinking of&nbsp;yourself lying in&nbsp;bed... Bye-bye, better luck next time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/28a/c6f/fde03c538987a6ccb913a0cfa1.png><p>Okay, you’re still in&nbsp;the house, focused on&nbsp;the things in&nbsp;the living room, not on&nbsp;your body. Time to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on, check out some of&nbsp;the other... Wait. Stop. You suddenly become very aware that you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;creepy old house all by&nbsp;yourself. Why did you go&nbsp;in, what were you thinking?</p><p>You start to&nbsp;feel extremely uncomfortable. What if&nbsp;s-s-s-someone lives here?<strong> </strong>So&nbsp;far, you’ve only been in&nbsp;the living room. You turn around and go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the hall. Okay, the door you came in&nbsp;through is&nbsp;still there, but there are some wooden stairs over there. You can’t quite see where they lead&nbsp;to... Did it&nbsp;suddenly get a&nbsp;bit darker, is&nbsp;the sun going down? Aaargh!</p><p>All of&nbsp;your biggest fears start popping up&nbsp;in&nbsp;your head. You suddenly hear snakes hissing, and... is&nbsp;that the sound of&nbsp;some giant animal, a&nbsp;dinosaur maybe? Oh&nbsp;no, is&nbsp;there a&nbsp;<a href=# title=chicken data-link=tag>chicken</a> in&nbsp;here too? Your biggest phobias are all gathered in&nbsp;one place!</p><p>The ground starts to&nbsp;shake, and you panic and turn around to&nbsp;flee. Oh&nbsp;no, the door’s gone! You take a&nbsp;step, and fall into a&nbsp;bottomless pit... which brings me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the second thing to&nbsp;avoid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/248/c1b/9b066d5c978543e18b83480bbd.png><p>Try not to&nbsp;think about things that scare you or&nbsp;make you feel uncomfortable. We’re all curious about scary scenarios, but your subconscious controls your dreams, and it&nbsp;knows all your suppressed fears, one tiny detail can escalate quickly, and turn a&nbsp;nice lucid dream into a&nbsp;nightmare. Or&nbsp;even wake you&nbsp;up. Might not be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;bad thing!</p><p>So, you bring your focus back to&nbsp;the nice things in&nbsp;the house, and the darkness disappears. Okay, good, the door’s back too. You walk outside, back to&nbsp;the main road... it’s a&nbsp;beautiful day!</p><p>Oh! Is&nbsp;that your old high school friend? Great, you were just thinking about her the other day, that’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great chance to&nbsp;chat. Stop right there!</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;lucid dreaming, the fewer real-life places, or&nbsp;people, the better. Lucid dreaming can make you feel like... it’s all real. It’s not like you’re going to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;and think you actually talked to&nbsp;that person, but your subconscious will memorize how you felt about&nbsp;it. That can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit confusing if&nbsp;you end up&nbsp;meeting her in&nbsp;real life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aaa/42e/f2cb405766828a5b288f56b595.png><p>Lucid dreams can create fake memories, which can lead to&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;real-world issues. So, the house, the road, the thick forest next to&nbsp;it... did your mind come up&nbsp;with that all by&nbsp;itself? Of&nbsp;course! Giraffes aren’t usually so&nbsp;tall their heads poke through the clouds, you can’t normally fly up&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick an&nbsp;apple from that top branch, and elephants don’t really wear awesome necklaces and earrings. Your dreamland doesn’t have any limits!</p><p>Hey! Enjoy it&nbsp;while you’re there. If&nbsp;you don’t, you might end up&nbsp;inside a&nbsp;boring dream where you slept through your alarm, again. You could even have a&nbsp;lucid nightmare. Or&nbsp;maybe they’re the same thing!</p><p>If&nbsp;you get too excited right away, your lucid dream could finish too quickly. Yes, lucid dreaming is&nbsp;like the best&nbsp;VR simulation ever, so&nbsp;duh... That’s why you want to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;last.</p><p>Sure, you can fly, see an&nbsp;epic waterfall, have magical powers, slide down a&nbsp;<a href=# title=rainbow data-link=tag>rainbow</a>, enjoy a&nbsp;tropical paradise with coconuts and palms... But, wait, wait, wait. Relax and try to&nbsp;stabilize your dream before you jump into any of&nbsp;that stuff. Start it&nbsp;off slowly with things that are more normal, like a&nbsp;road, house, meadow, ooh hey, look! Cute little rabbits and a&nbsp;deer! Much better to&nbsp;start your dream off that way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/97f/964/cc090a5d21ae56cf236d3fcc6e.png><p>It&nbsp;takes some time to&nbsp;become skilled enough to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all those crazy things without waking&nbsp;up. You want it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;amazing, and not just... meh, boring or&nbsp;frustrating, or&nbsp;worst of&nbsp;all: end too soon. But, also, keep moving, don’t aimlessly wander around. Forest, road, house, blah blah blah... Sounds interesting at&nbsp;first, but eventually, you should move on&nbsp;to&nbsp;more fun things. Make a&nbsp;plan.</p><p>In&nbsp;lucid dreams, time goes slower than it&nbsp;does in&nbsp;reality&nbsp;so: use. It. Well. Don’t try too hard to&nbsp;control everything in&nbsp;your dream. First off, that takes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;practice, and second, let some things surprise you. Hopefully not some phobias hidden in&nbsp;the dark corners of&nbsp;your subconscious...</p><p>Keep your eyes open in&nbsp;the dream. How else are you going to&nbsp;see all the wonders of&nbsp;the dream world? Closing your eyes a&nbsp;lot can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign to&nbsp;your body that you want to&nbsp;wake&nbsp;up. It’s helpful when you’re stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad dream and can’t make those scary creatures go&nbsp;away. But, if&nbsp;you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good place...</p><p>Don’t spend too much time in&nbsp;your dreams, lucid or&nbsp;regular ones. They all happen during your REM (rapid eye movement) sleep phase. In&nbsp;non-REM sleep, your eye movements, heart rate, and brain waves gradually slow down. And, then, BAM!!, REM-phase comes around, and your brain starts having fun!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/243/733/f2aadf5f05bef715f052c1ae9f.png><p>More than half the world’s experienced lucid dreams at&nbsp;least once, but few people can actually control them. Maybe that’s not a&nbsp;bad thing, because knowing there’s a&nbsp;place where you can do&nbsp;literally anything you imagine... Phew. You might start to&nbsp;lose touch with reality!</p><p>But, when you’re there, don’t leave anything on&nbsp;your bucket list. How about flying? You’re at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;high mountain, and thick fluffy clouds are all around you. Where’s the ground? You look down.</p><p>Wahoo! In&nbsp;your dream, you’re not afraid of&nbsp;heights! You feel the adrenaline pumping through your body... go&nbsp;for&nbsp;it, jump, spread your wings. Oh, by&nbsp;the way, you now have wings!</p><p>Or&nbsp;what&nbsp;if, like&nbsp;me, you want to&nbsp;swim deep down into the ocean? You’re on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small boat, you take a&nbsp;few deep breaths, feel the crisp air penetrating your lungs. One final inhale, you crouch down and, splash! The best part is&nbsp;when you’re dreaming, the salt-water doesn’t sting your eyes!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIRuwMeipaCrXa68tnnSoaaupJSjwW6x1Z6pZpyfYravecBmm6udkaJ6eX2TbHByZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
