Despite fan theories that Jade was having an affair with Johnson’s husband, <a href=#>Val Chmerkovskiy</a>, the women were all laughs and showed support <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the episode</a>.</strong></p><p>Johnson and Chmerkovskiy both made it far this season on Dancing With The Stars. Johnson was partnered with <a href=#>Jojo Siwa</a>, the first ever same-sex partnership on the show, while Chmerkovskiy was partnered with Jade.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dancing with the Stars Season 30 Breaks Barriers</h2><p>On her podcast, Jade mentioned that she was nervous to be seen in public after the <a href=#>admissions scandal</a> she went through in 2019. Johnson said because of Chmerkovskiy’s “caring nature and the ability to be who he is,” she is happy that he was there to help Jade during her moment in the spotlight. She described Chmerkovskiy as the perfect partner for Jade.</p><p>By the time Season 30 arrived, Johnson and Chmerkovskiy had been married for two years. When Chmerkovskiy was paired with Jade, TikTok users began to spread gossip about a possible affair between the two. They often referenced how much chemistry the dance partners had on the dance floor. The gossip also began to question if Johnson was having an affair with Siwa. All four have denied all rumors, and actually find the speculation comical.</p><p>On the podcast, Johnson mentioned that she was not nervous to be part of the first same-sex dance team on this past season. Knowing that she grew up in a Christian household, she wanted to inform her parents. When she told the news to her father, Jenna said his response was “what an honor that they trusted you with this.”</p><p>During the sit down, Johnson shared that she recognized Siwa had a lot on her shoulders this season. One day in her trailer, Johnson even refused to dance if Siwa did not change the baggy shirt she was wearing.</p><p>Johnson said Siwa admitted to her that she was not the most confident in her appearance, which led to tears. After Johnson said some words of affirmation to her dance partner, Siwa changed outfits. The next day, she showed up in a crop top.</p><p>When asked about the return of the <a href=#>Dancing With</a> <a href=#>The Stars</a> tour, Johnson said that she and Chmerkovskiy will not be participating this year. They both are looking forward to enjoying married life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CXJbcy8MbQo/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-and-val-s-romance-in-the-ballroom>Jenna and Val’s Romance in the Ballroom</h2><p>At age 18, Johnson tried out for Fox’s So You Think You Can Dance. She came in fourth place on Season 10 of the show, which got the attention of Dancing With The Stars. Producers offered her a job soon after. From Seasons 18 to 22, Johnson was a troupe member until she became a partnered professional dancer on Season 23 of the show.</p><p>According to Johnson, Chmerkovskiy was the first person who spoke to her on the Dancing With The Stars set. She was the only dancer that was new on Season 18, so she was focused on her new opportunity and did not pay attention to Chmerkovskiy.</p><p>During one rehearsal however, Johnson complimented Chmerkovskiy’s cologne. She said that his response was that “she could sell the cologne in the streets of New York City.”</p><p>Jenna admitted on the podcast that she never wanted to date a dancer. She did not think much of Chmerkovskiy’s flirting. Eventually, the two began dating and Chmerkovskiy proposed in the most romantic way. Johnson said that she was shocked about the thoughtful gestures that Chmerkovskiy pulled off to propose.</p><p>After Season 16 of Dancing With The Stars, Chmerkovskiy and Johnson took a trip to Amsterdam and then to Venice. After a romantic dinner, a live band began to play their favorite song “Volare.”</p><p>While they danced, Chmerkovskiy told Johnson that he promised himself the next time he was in Venice, it would be when he was proposing to someone. He got on one knee and proposed, leaving her speechless.</p><p>While it’s still unclear whether or not Chmerkovskiy will return to Dancing with the Stars for Season 31, fans are sure to get more romantic moments between these two.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1356739545.jpg alt="Carrie Underwood, Ed Sheeran, More Stars to Perform During ‘The Voice’ Finale" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWarka7AbsLApWScoJ2av6y71ayiorFdrK60ec%2BeqZ%2Bdk6l6pcPTrGSpmaKpu6a%2BjJ%2Bmq2Wfoba3tcBmoZqclWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
