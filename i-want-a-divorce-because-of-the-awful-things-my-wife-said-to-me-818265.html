My&nbsp;wife was asleep, the kids were playing, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Sunday. She finally woke up&nbsp;at&nbsp;11:30. She called and asked me&nbsp;where I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;shared my&nbsp;location, I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Hone Depot or&nbsp;next door at&nbsp;the diner eating. I&nbsp;was 30&nbsp;minutes away. She demanded&nbsp;I come home right that second.</p><p>Basically upset, she woke&nbsp;up, and&nbsp;I wasn’t home. I&nbsp;had been up&nbsp;since 6:30 doing errands, exercising, and getting the kids settled, I&nbsp;left at&nbsp;10:00&nbsp;AM. I&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the kids mainly because&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;flexible schedule. My&nbsp;wife works PT. I&nbsp;make 2x&nbsp;more than her also.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b14/ce3/df81505ecb9a080e099399ddce.jpg><p>Well, I&nbsp;take an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;get home. When I&nbsp;got back, she started yelling at&nbsp;me, saying&nbsp;I was worthless, and if&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, she was going to&nbsp;take the kids and leave.</p><p>Ever since then, knowing how family courts are, I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I was living with an&nbsp;assassin. She has the target on&nbsp;me&nbsp;and is&nbsp;just waiting to&nbsp;pull the trigger. I&nbsp;told her numerous times her statements and threats that day highly affected&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;therapy and told my&nbsp;therapist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b00/0bf/d0910353b49fe2e11e0dac075c.jpg><p>My&nbsp;wife, my&nbsp;friends, and my&nbsp;parents all told me&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;get over&nbsp;it, and&nbsp;I was being sensitive. Obviously, my&nbsp;wife was just upset and apologized. Even my&nbsp;therapist said she apologized, why isn’t that enough?</p><p>Well, it’s been a&nbsp;year... I’m still not over&nbsp;it. Everyone including my&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;acting like everything is&nbsp;great. We&nbsp;just took a&nbsp;week’s <a href=# title=vacation data-link=tag>vacation</a> in&nbsp;February as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. I&nbsp;was there, but&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I can’t even openly speak to&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife anymore because battle lines have been drawn.</p><p>Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong for holding my&nbsp;wife’s statements a&nbsp;year later and being unable to&nbsp;forgive her? I&nbsp;am acting like everything is&nbsp;fine. To&nbsp;avoid interacting with her, I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;second job in&nbsp;the evening after the kids got home from school and finished their homework. So&nbsp;she just thinks I’m busy, not avoiding her.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;then added more information.</h2></p><p>Our kids are Elementary age (7&nbsp;and 9). The kids basically have their own floor with a&nbsp;bedroom, bathroom, and playroom. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer, and two business associates said they wouldn’t give me&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer because I’m overreacting.</p><p>I&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;people older than&nbsp;me, both male and female, and they all kept telling me&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;and get over&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;whole deck of&nbsp;cards to&nbsp;play before&nbsp;I call a&nbsp;lawyer. My&nbsp;buddy who is&nbsp;55&nbsp;hung up&nbsp;on&nbsp;me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I asked him. He&nbsp;called me&nbsp;back a&nbsp;week later and said he&nbsp;would drive me&nbsp;to&nbsp;meet with a&nbsp;lawyer if&nbsp;I still wanted&nbsp;to.</p><p>We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;large Metro, but a&nbsp;small <a href=# title=affluent data-link=tag>affluent</a> suburb. The type of&nbsp;place where everyone is&nbsp;very well-connected. I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;vacation with my&nbsp;buddy last year, and we&nbsp;ran into my&nbsp;neighbor at&nbsp;the airport, by&nbsp;the time&nbsp;I returned home a&nbsp;few days later, people at&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids’ school knew&nbsp;I went out of&nbsp;town and knew my&nbsp;buddy’s name. I&nbsp;normally walk the same route every day with our dog. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;foot injury, and couldn’t walk for two weeks. I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the local pharmacy and some random lady asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I was doing okay, she hadn’t seen me&nbsp;walking, and she knew what time to&nbsp;leave for work based on&nbsp;when&nbsp;I walked by&nbsp;the park near her house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/f16/67d0a452169ed32caac41bf39e.jpg><p>My&nbsp;wife has threatened to&nbsp;leave me&nbsp;several times. We&nbsp;have been together for almost 20&nbsp;years. But I&nbsp;always felt she was just acting out or&nbsp;blowing smoke. She put our children in&nbsp;the mix with this threat. I&nbsp;can admit she hasn’t made a&nbsp;threat like that since last year. I&nbsp;think she knows she overstepped big time. But I&nbsp;can’t help but feel I’m going to&nbsp;get ambushed one day.</p><p>Also, I&nbsp;went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;websites of&nbsp;divorce lawyers in&nbsp;our state, and they have calculators on&nbsp;them for alimony and child support. If&nbsp;she pulls the trigger on&nbsp;this, I’m losing big. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;have a&nbsp;post-nuptial agreement that a&nbsp;lawyer created. I&nbsp;even talked to&nbsp;a&nbsp;buddy about renting his studio out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;building he&nbsp;is&nbsp;constructing. Maybe to&nbsp;just sleep somewhere else while&nbsp;I figure this all out. Everyone is&nbsp;telling me&nbsp;to&nbsp;either suck it&nbsp;up&nbsp;or&nbsp;pay up&nbsp;for my&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>My&nbsp;therapist in&nbsp;August asked me&nbsp;point-blank if&nbsp;I still wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married. I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I don’t know. But I&nbsp;have done some rough calculations on&nbsp;what that would cost. The number is&nbsp;so&nbsp;big, I&nbsp;don’t even know if&nbsp;it’s worth&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar position 15–20 years ago. He&nbsp;still got divorced. He&nbsp;still had to&nbsp;pay, it’s just money. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;waited until his youngest turned&nbsp;18, but he&nbsp;started planning his exit about 8&nbsp;years prior...which is&nbsp;the only advice anyone is&nbsp;giving&nbsp;me. Just wait for my&nbsp;wife out.</p><p><h2>And people shared their opinions.</h2></p><ul><li>«This sounds like a&nbsp;guy who has made up&nbsp;his mind, decided he&nbsp;wants a&nbsp;divorce, but has spent the past year looking for the neon sign that says, ’you’re right!’ before filing the papers because he&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;look bad to&nbsp;other people.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rikaragnarok&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Maybe she was a&nbsp;touch upset because he&nbsp;left the kids essentially unsupervised for an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half, since she was asleep and had no&nbsp;idea he’d gone out.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Spank86&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«He&nbsp;can’t forgive her for something she said in&nbsp;anger and then apologized for when he’s actually thinking and planning to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;secret. The post sounds like he&nbsp;deeply resents her for many reasons, but he&nbsp;can’t bear being the bad guy, so&nbsp;he’s projecting the desire for the end of&nbsp;the marriage onto her instead of&nbsp;owning&nbsp;it.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Archgate82&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed6/31a/66b7f457e1972d6783aef4636f.jpg><ul><li>«And he&nbsp;took another job to&nbsp;avoid her instead of&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her about&nbsp;it?
