This singer brought their love of drag to the Alter Ego stage with their avatar, Nevaeh King. Previously, they auditioned for <a href=#>The Voice</a> and American Idol, but what really makes Alter Ego different is that tight-tight suit, and the great people they met.</strong></p><p>Jay says that they were on the X Factor when they were 23 years old and later went to an open call and audition for The Voice. They even went on to audition for <a href=#>American Idol</a>. They said their boss at the time told them to go for their dreams and suggested that they should go to the open call.</p><p>From there, Jay was able to go into rehearsals and eventually made it in front of the coaches. Since they made it so far already, they thought for sure that the coaches would turn their chairs for them. But they didn’t. As soon as they got off the stage, <a href=#>Carson Daly</a> told them to audition again in the future, and they declined.</p><p>“I’ve had a sea of ‘nos’ my whole life, what’s another one?” Jay said. “Leaving there, I definitely wasn’t in the best frame of mind. I sat and did some digging and some reflecting and some unpacking. I realized that I am a ‘yes’ and I am enough in a world that’s never enough… and something changed inside of me. I won.”</p><p>Since their rejection from The Voice, Jay has worked to always have a positive mindset. They don’t compare themself or their growth to others, and they always believes they’re a winner. May I also add, Jay told me that they were working full time and still made it all happen on the show.</p><p>The weeks after they were on The Voice was truly a period of growth for them. Alter Ego was a bit different for Jay since a producer reached out to via Instagram and asked for them to be on the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-it-s-really-like-to-perform-on-fox-s-new-stage>What it’s Really Like to Perform on FOX’s new Stage</h2><p>Jay pulled inspiration from their love of drag for the creation of their avatar. They felt like they could be freely themself with the creation of their avatar <a href=#>Naveah King</a> who is a mix between Marilyn Monroe and Jessica Rabbit. They enjoyed every part of the avatar itself, but they did say the suit was tight. They shared that <a href=#>Danielle Cetani and other contestants</a> made jokes about how they were ninjas while backstage.</p><p>The show itself seemed very different from anything else Jay had ever done. Jay shared that the suit was full body and they would wear it for the full day. They felt as if the avatar was a buffer between them and the stage in the series.</p><p>“Being in the back and having the Alter Ego in front. It does take off a lot of that pressure,” they said. “You have to look a certain way, be a certain height, all the things, the -isms we all can buy into cause of that is subjective. It was so neat to be backstage and not have all of that stress.”</p><p>Jay mentioned how close of a group the <a href=#>contestants</a> ended up being after the show concluded. They said the cast still texts in a group chat to this day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-next-for-jay-after-alter-ego>What’s Next for Jay After Alter Ego?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Jay isn’t currently trying to audition for <a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race</a>, even though they’d be perfect for the show. But Jay did say they would love go on the show if the opportunity arose. Right now, they’re focused on their music and they’re so excited to move forward into the unknown. They just want to continue performing for the time being.</p><p>Jay is hoping to ride the wave and see where it brings them in the future. I cannot wait to see how Jay does on Alter Ego tonight. It’s so obvious that they have a giant career ahead of them.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Unknown-2-e1632965756602.jpeg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Recap: Dalmatian Revealed to be Superstar Rapper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWrnqpdmrSwv4yjmLJlnZ6uqXnDnpqinJWZeqp5wKZkmmWpmsBurcWtnKtlpJ2ybsLOopqeZZGqsarAyKilaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
