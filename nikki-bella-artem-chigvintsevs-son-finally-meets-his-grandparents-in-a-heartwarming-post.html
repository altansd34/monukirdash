The moment is only made sweeter given the fact that Bella and Chigvintsev’s wedding was pushed back from 2020 to August of 2022, for Chigvintsev’s parents to attend the wedding. Unfortunately they attended the wedding virtually due to travel restrictions.</p><p>In a post on Chigvintsev’s Instagram account, the former WWE wrestler and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS pro</a>‘s son Matteo, can be seen together with his grandparents. Chigvintsev shared a series of photos capturing the heartfelt reunion. In the first photo, Matteo is seen together with his grandmother holding him up. The second photo shows the grandparents, who are all smiles as they look down on Matteo laying down.</p><p>It’s clear that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bella</a> and Chigvinstev have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to introduce their son to his grandparents. The couple has been vocal about their desire to have both families involved in their lives. The couple welcomed Matteo on the same year they originally planned to have the wedding in 2020. Only recently able to have the chance to spend time with his grandparents.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bella, Chigvintsev Found Out Matteo Was Too Sick to be the Ring Bearer For Their Wedding</h2><p>It was unfortunate that an unexpected occurrence derailed their wedding plans, after Bella managed to plan everything in four weeks. The couple’s son, Matteo, who was supposed to be the ring bearer at their wedding, fell ill just hours before the ceremony.</p><p>Instead of pushing forward with the wedding as planned, they made the difficult decision to prioritize their son’s well-being. Bella explained that they had to scramble to find someone to fill in for Matteo as the ring bearer. Emphasis was placed on the fact that their focus was on their son and making sure he was okay.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Nikki and Artem’s decision to put their family first doesn’t mean that their wedding day was any less special. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. By prioritizing their family, they demonstrated the strength of their relationship and the values that they hold.</p><p>In the end, Matteo was able to make a speedy recovery. Things don’t always go as planned, but with a little flexibility and perseverance, everything can work out in the end.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_MileyCyrus_Vijat-MohindraNBC-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Miley Cyrus’s ‘Flowers’ Continues to Rule Pop Charts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKipKFdl7KtuMBmmKuslaJ6pLTIoK2ipqSosre%2FjKymp2WWnruiuMuyZKadlanAbrTIrGSgqpGjsbGt0Z6lratdnrturYyhnJqqpKyus7nIp55mqJ%2BowXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
