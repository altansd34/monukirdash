This technique is one of the two methods for removing an unwanted design, the other option being laser removal. Here are some tattoo cover-up ideas you <a href=#>can</a> use to hide the mistakes of your youth.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5564921a168c358e.jpg><p class=align-left>Tattoos are not easy to remove once they are inked on your body. Therefore, a tattoo cover-up can be an excellent solution to dealing with an old or unwanted design. However, you should look for an artist that will incorporate the hard lines of the old tattoo into the new design so that it appears like the old design never existed.</p><h2>50 tattoo cover-up ideas</h2><p class=align-left>If you are considering modifying an unwanted tatt and looking for some inspiration, below is a list of some tattoo cover-up ideas to inspire you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ec7c53c49291f20.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Building 'Mad Max' vehicles for Ukraine's fighters</span></p></a><h3>1. Wings and heart tattoo cover-up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ec7c53c49291f20.jpg><p class=align-left>The old design has a heart shape in the middle and two wings. It has become unidentifiable because of the faded colour. To cover it, the artist has used the wings' blue colours as the <a href=#>background</a> to come up with a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/top/1518943-most-beautiful-birds-world-top-10-avian-works-art/ href=#>beautiful bird</a> on top.</p><h3>2. Butterfly tattoo cover-up</h3><p class=align-left>Flowers and butterflies are, in many cases, used together in most female tattoos. In this case, the shoulder tattoo is a bit different. It was originally a single butterfly that faded over time. It has, however, been redesigned to create a flower and a butterfly.</p><h3>3 Upper arm cover-up idea</h3><p class=align-left>You can use the above technique to keep the elements of the original design you like but revamp the parts you donâ€™t. It is a huge improvement that adds more depth and shade to your design.</p><h3>4. Lion tattoo cover-up</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9d100a37fc6d6e4c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to slay in fierce power suits: Ini Edo, 5 other celebrities serve boss babe looks</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/719390a8de448259.jpg><p class=align-left>Here is another idea to entirely cover a tattoo with a much bigger one. In most cases, the cover-up designs take up more space than the original ones. The design was initially a simple image on the upper arm but was covered to create a much bigger portrait of a lion.</p><h3>5. Ouroboros to wreath cover-up</h3><p class=align-left>Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a snake eating its own tail to signify unity and infinity. This original design can be covered by turning it into a beautiful wreath.</p><h3>6. Leaves cover-up on the shoulder</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9d100a37fc6d6e4c.jpg><p class=align-left>This design is one of the cover-up tattoo ideas for females, especially those who love to get their boyfriends' names inked on their bodies. The original design has some love heart symbols and words. The artist has used leaves to cover the initial image.</p><h3>7. Beautiful landscape cover-up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b6118c8b8f6c69f5.jpg><p class=align-left>Landscape is a great cover-up idea, especially for those who feel inspired by nature. While it may not be the first approach that comes to your mind when considering a cover-up tattoo, it can work well, depending on your preferred design.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d10261059b1b98f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to hide bra strap under mono sleeve dress: Fashionista shares impressive hack</span></p></a><h3>8.

The artist has just incorporated a red colour and a curvy line to change the original design.</p><h3>9. Quote to art</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/42b90f79044e6125.jpg><p class=align-left>While quote tattoos may be meaningful at the beginning, you might outgrow them over time. To make the design appear artistic and creative, your artist can incorporate a tree line under a starry night.</p><h3>10. Beautiful cover-up tattoo on the waist with flowers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d10261059b1b98f.jpg><p class=align-left>Flowers are often considered one of the best tattoo cover-up ideas. A talented artist can use them to create a stunning design that effectively conceals any existing work.</p><h3>11. Small wrist cover-up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1592024ac86474b2.jpg><p class=align-left>Some artists prefer using the previous design as part of their new creation. For instance, in this image, the fading colours of the moon have been used as a background for the new design.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1d4bbf74c73a12ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 fun games to play with your boyfriend or girlfriend when bored</span></p></a><h3>12. Pear into grapes arm cover-up</h3><p class=align-left>Cover-up tattoos can be similar to the old ones, with only a slight difference. You may still love part of the old tattoo, whether it is the style, colour, or design. The above grape design has been used to create a different piece on top of the old one.</p><h3>13. Coloured full-sleeve cover-up tattoo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/835a1fa8c3356c82.jpg><p class=align-left>Some prefer tattoos that cover the whole sleeve. In the image above, the old tattoo was inked in the middle of the arm in the elbow section. However, the artist replaced it with a design covering the entire sleeve to give it a beautiful scene.</p><h3>14. Small to large wrist cover-up</h3><p class=align-left>The above old wrist tattoo was relatively small. However, the cover-up has been extended along the forearm to hide the ink to create a more detailed design.</p><h3>15. Letter tattoos into landscapes</h3><p class=align-left>Consider landscape tattoos if you are still struggling to get good cover-up tattoo ideas. The new design has been made of trees and mountains to give it a natural look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8d066affa8669c22.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 simple things to draw on your hand with a pen when bored</span></p></a><h3>16.

Tiger tattoo cover-up</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/350836916f35c74d.jpg><p class=align-left>Tigers have been a significant source of motivation for tattoo designers.

It is hard to tell what was once underneath that detailed shading.</p><h3>20. Diamond cover-up</h3><p class=align-left>Diamonds can be used as a tattoo cover-up for a bad old design or one that has faded away. Some people use the element as a cover-up after a heartbreak because they represent strength.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/310fbaf3aa474566.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ meaningful forearm tattoos for women: great ideas to consider</span></p></a><h3>21.

However, their love may fade over time, creating the desire to hide it. In the case above, the tattoo artist has combined the cat and the sun to form a beautiful feminine lion.</p><h3>23. Faded black ankle tatt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/149e7d47ffde5d56.jpg><p class=align-left>The above image shows that dark blue is a great cover-up colour as it perfectly covers the faded ink beneath it.
