(She has a daughter named Birdie and a son named Buddy with husband Daniel Bryan.) She said they’re “discussing it,” but explained, “I’m kind of like one and done. I’m happy with that, but we’ll see.”</p><p>Bella joked that things would be easier if Chigvintsev could carry the baby instead of her. He replied, “I would! Let’s figure it out.”</p><p>The couple met when they competed on Dancing with the Stars Season 25 together. Matteo was born in July 2020, and Bella married Chigvintsev in Paris in August 2022.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NIKKI BELLA, ARTEM CHIGVINTSEV TALK ABOUT PLANNING THEIR WEDDING IN FOUR WEEKS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-appears-in-a-reality-show-about-their-wedding>The Couple Appears in a Reality Show About Their Wedding</h2><p>Currently, a reality show is airing on E! that details the events leading up to Bella and Chigvintsev’s nuptials, as the couple tried to plan the wedding in four weeks.
