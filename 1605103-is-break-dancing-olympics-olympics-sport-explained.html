Toprock</h4><p class=align-left>Toprock refers to moves performed while standing up, focusing heavily on footwork. It serves as the introduction to a breaking routine and sets the rhythm and <a href=#>energy</a> for the performance. Various steps and moves, such as the Indian, salsa, and crossover steps, characterise toprock.</p><h4 id=1605103-2-downrock class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Downrock</h4><p class=align-left>Downrock, or footwork, involves moves performed on the floor. It includes intricate patterns of steps using hands and feet to support the body.

These require <a href=#>significant strength</a>, balance, and coordination. Power moves include a headspin, where the dancer spins on their head; a windmill, where dancers spin on their shoulders; and flare, where legs are swung around in a circular motion while the hands support the body.</p><h4 id=1605103-4-freezes class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Freezes</h4><p class=align-left>Freezes are poses where the dancer suddenly stops moving and holds a position. This move demonstrates control and strength.

These sports aim to bring a modern and youthful dynamic to the games. Some of these <a id=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-olympic-sports-summer-2024/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">new sports</a> are highlighted below.</p><ul><li><strong>Skateboarding:</strong> Skateboarding features two main disciplines: street and park. In the street discipline, skaters navigate a course mimicking an urban environment, performing tricks on stairs, handrails, benches, and walls. The park discipline occurs in a dome-shaped bowl with various curves, allowing skaters to execute aerial tricks and gain significant airtime.</li><li><strong>Sport climbing</strong>: Sport climbing includes three disciplines: lead climbing, speed climbing, and bouldering. In lead climbing, climbers attempt to reach the highest point on a wall within a set time. Speed climbing pits two climbers against each other in a race to the top of a 15-metre wall. Conversely, bouldering challenges athletes to solve complex climbing routes on a lower wall without ropes.</li><li><strong>Surfing:</strong> Surfing features men's and women's shortboard events, where surfers ride and perform manoeuvres on ocean waves. Judging criteria include wave selection, the difficulty and innovation of the manoeuvres, the combination of significant moves, and overall speed, power, and flow.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5cc8b52159251925.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 best British rappers that should be on your radar</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Is break dancing in the Olympics?
