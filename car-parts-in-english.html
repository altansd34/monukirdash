And, for the most part, car rentals go off without a hitch. But when things go wrong, you’ll likely need to explain what happened. Unless you’re a multilingual maestro, the likelihood is that you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the names of different car parts in <a href=#>English</a>. This is certainly true in the United States and England, but English is used as a business language in many other parts of the world, too.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we’re here to explain the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a> you’ll need to talk about cars in English — from the brakes to the bumper and from the hood to the trunk. Buckle up and get ready to explore the fascinating world of car-related words in English.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-front>The front</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Hood</h3><p>Let’s start with the <strong>hood</strong>: the front of the car, under which you can find the engine. There’s usually a lever on the driver’s side to lift the hood. We recommend finding it before you need to use it, because no one wants to be scrabbling around in the dark trying to<strong> pop the hood</strong> in an emergency. Note that the hood is called the <strong>bonnet </strong>in the UK and many other countries.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Bumper</h3><p>A typical car has two <strong>bumpers </strong>— one<strong> </strong>at the front and one at the back. This reinforced strip of plastic and/or metal helps protect your car in case of a collision or parking mishap.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Headlights</h3><p>The <strong>headlights</strong> are the two high-powered lights on the front of your car. Make sure to check local laws to know whether your car lights need to be on during the daytime, and don’t mistake your <strong>high beams</strong> (more powerful lights that help you see further down the road) for your <strong>low beams</strong> (the standard lights you’ll want to use while in traffic).&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Windshield</h3><p>At the front of the car, there is a very large piece of glass called the <strong>windshield</strong>, or <strong>windscreen</strong> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British English</a>. It’s there to make sure wind, bugs and harmful projectiles don’t fly straight into your eyes while you’re driving. You should have <strong>windshield wipers</strong> to clear water from the glass.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Side mirrors</h3><p>This one is self-explanatory. The <strong>side mirrors</strong> are on the sides of your car; one on the driver’s side and the other on the passenger side. They’re called <strong>wing mirrors</strong> in British English.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Tires</h3><p>At the front and back of the car on either side are the tires (spelled <strong>tyres</strong> in British English). A standard car has four tires;&nbsp; they’re the thick rubber rings filled with air. If there’s not enough air in them, you may have a <strong>flat tire</strong>. Luckily, most cars have a <strong>spare tire</strong> somewhere — typically beneath the vehicle or in a compartment underneath the floorboard of the trunk.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-back>The back</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Trunk</h3><p>The <strong>trunk</strong> is the hood’s counterpart at the back of the car. It has a different name in British English: the <strong>boot</strong>. This is where you keep your suitcases and probably find the spare tire and the emergency kit for the car (first-aid kit, high-visibility vest, etc.).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Tail lights</h3><p>The <strong>tail lights</strong> are the red and white lights at the back of your car that flash when you’re <strong>braking</strong> (i.e. slowing down) and occasionally at other moments, such as when you first start the car.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Fuel tank</h3><p>The <strong>fuel tank</strong> is where you fill up the car with gas. There’s usually a little door covering the tank that requires a simple press or pull to open. Always check which type of fuel your vehicle takes before cruising out of the rental station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As we mentioned above, you should also have a bumper on the back of the car.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-power>The power</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Engine</h3><p>The heart and soul of your car, the <strong>engine</strong> lives under the hood and is a powerful machine that makes the car work.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Battery</h3><p>The <strong>car battery</strong> produces the electricity that makes the car work. If the battery is no longer working, you have a <strong>flat battery</strong>. This is a more common problem with older cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Brakes</h3><p>Your <strong>brakes</strong> bring your car to a stop, ensuring safety on the road. Someone might tell you to “<strong>hit the brakes</strong>” if they want you to stop.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Gas/Accelerator</h3><p>The opposite of the brakes is the <strong>gas pedal</strong> or the <strong>accelerator pedal</strong>. If someone tells you to “<strong>step on it</strong>,” they mean to push harder on the gas pedal and drive faster. They might also tell you to “<strong>hit the gas</strong>.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-interior>The interior</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Steering wheel</h3><p>Turn the <strong>steering wheel</strong> to point your car in the direction you wish to drive.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Dashboard</h3><p>The command center! The <strong>dashboard</strong> displays crucial information like the speed, fuel level and which side your fuel tank is on so you can avoid embarrassment at the gas station.It’s also home to a whole host of warning lights that hopefully you won’t see lit up.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Stick shift</h3><p>Most Americans are accustomed to driving an automatic car, but abroad, <strong>manual cars</strong> are often the norm. And there, right between the driver’s seat and the passenger seat, is the dreaded <strong>stick shift</strong> that you use to <strong>change gears</strong>. Automatic cars have a version of this too, but it’s much simpler.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Airbags</h3><p>An <strong>airbag</strong> is a protective cushion that deploys during collisions, offering a softer and hopefully less damaging point of impact.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Parking brake</h3><p>Also called a <strong>handbrake</strong> in British English, this is a device that locks into position and stops the vehicle from moving. It’s operated by hand (hence the name in British English) and it sits near the stick shift. You need to <strong>release </strong>or <strong>take off </strong>the parking brake before you <strong>set off </strong>(begin driving).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ready to hit the road?</h2><p>Now that you’ve mastered the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a> of car parts in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, you’re ready to enjoy the open road with confidence. You can tell the mechanic when you have a flat tire or flat battery and ask for the windshield to be cleaned while you’re putting fuel in the tank. So, rev up your engine and enjoy the ride!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
