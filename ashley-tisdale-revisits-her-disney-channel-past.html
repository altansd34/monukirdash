In a trip to her storage unit, the actress showed off her iconic outfits from her Disney Channel roles.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ashley-tisdale-still-has-the-iconic-bop-to-the-top-dress-from-high-school-musical>Ashley Tisdale Still Has The Iconic ‚ÄúBop to The Top‚Äù Dress From High School Musical</h2><p>Longtime fans of the actress were surprised to see photos from her storage unit this past weekend. Within her Instagram stories, Tisdale showed off an old perfume campaign, a behind the scenes photo, and two costumes.</p><p>As many know, Tisdale‚Äôs debut Disney Channel role was as Maddie Fitzpatrick on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody in 2005. Within the show, she acted as the candy counter girl in the hotel Zack and Cody live in. Maddie Fitzpatrick was typically seen in the hotel, so it‚Äôs no surprise that Tisdale would keep her signature outfit.</p><p>In a separate Instagram story, Tisdale revealed that she still has one of best dresses from the High School Musical trilogy. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, High School Musical follows a set of high schoolers through their time in East High School. The Disney Channel original movie premiered in 2006, while the second premiered in 2007, and the third came out in 2008.</p><p>Tisdale‚Äôs character, Sharpay Evans is quite the fashionista, but this dress is so iconic that she wore it in two movies! If you don‚Äôt know which dress I‚Äôm talking about, it‚Äôs Sharpay‚Äôs ‚ÄúBop to The Top‚Äù dress from the original film. Tisdale is seen wearing this dress in the third film as well, when Sharpay‚Äôs assistant attempts to take over her final on stage performance.</p><p>In addition to the costumes, Tisdale shared a photo of her behind the scenes on the set of High School Musical. This throwback really made all Gen Z‚Äôs inner children come out.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ASHLEY TISDALE YOU GOT ME IN MY FEELS ü§ß THE NOSTALGIA HIT ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lc9xZj8tU4</a></p>‚Äî Shrvya | GOOD RIDDANCE ‚òÜ (@shrvztweets) <a href=#>February 19, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She‚Äôs Revealed That Her Favorite Childhood Memory Is Working</h2><p>Since Tisdale began acting at the age of three, she‚Äôs begun looking back as an adult. Within a recent interview, the actress admitted that her happiest childhood moments involved work.</p><p>‚ÄúI thought that was normal for an 8-year-old,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLooking back, that is not normal.‚Äù</p><p>Even touring with the cast of High School Musical was noted as one of her favorite moments. Even though she was young at the time, the actress was reportedly never separated from her family. Her mother traveled with the tour, while her father and sister appeared at many city stops.</p><p>‚ÄúIt was something I absolutely loved,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was so hard to get me off the tour. I was obsessed with it.‚Äù</p><p>As an adult, Tisdale explored her passion for interior design work and self care.
