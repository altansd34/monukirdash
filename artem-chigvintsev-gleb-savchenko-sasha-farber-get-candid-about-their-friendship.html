Apparently, they first met in while performing at a special event in Australia. There, they bonded for approximately two weeks, forming a unique relationship that has now been strong more than ever.</p><p>“We just had a lot of fun, it was easy,” Farber said. “We get along with each other, we just like the same things. We liked the same food, we kinda painted Australia red.”</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Farber</a> initially met the two in Australia, it wasn’t the first time that Savchenko met Chigvintsev. Reportedly, the two competed in the same dance competitions years back. Since Savchenko and Chigvintsev were originally rivals, they didn’t form a friendship until later in life.</p><p>“When you were not in the same dance studio, you never really talk,” Savchenko said. “One day, I see him taking the train to the dance studio where I was and that’s how we started talking. That’s how we became friends.”</p><p>During the podcast, Savchenko admitted that he’s always been a fan of Chigvintsev. He stated that his friend is a “great choreographer” whose pieces were never bad.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chigvintsev Says Dancing in Bar Mitzvahs Was The Worst Job</h2><p>They have also recalled the awful dancing jobs they had, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chigvintsev </a>mentioning bar mitzvahs as his worst ballroom dancing venue. According to him, he used to teach dancing to students and perform in weddings when he moved to the United States.</p><p>“[I was] teaching students but the other one there was a lot of like weddings, especially in the Russian community,” he said. “It’s the worst especially if you’re a ballroom dancer because most of the time whenever you start dancing, everybody [is] already drunk. So you [are] literally just dancing for people who really don’t really care much.”</p><p>Later in the interview, the three took the time to remember their special moments together. For Chigvintsev, it was the casual barbecue dates in whoever’s house that matter the most. The “chill and talk” outside the dance floor is apparently what makes these pros sentimental about their companionship.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/KatyPerry_BillieEilish-220x147.jpg alt="Katy Perry Admits She Turned Down the Chance to Work with Billie Eilish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKurnqVdmLWqs9Wipa2rlat6qLjEm2SsmaaYtaa6yqhkrJmjna5ussCrmZ6qXZyytXnCmqWdoZRirqO71K1kraCVnr9ustGinKeco522sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
