Saving money, therefore, is naturally a compelling reason for upgrading to more energy-efficient technology at home. An earlier Morning Consult analysis found that 20% of consumers said they would consider purchasing new or upgrading existing smart-home devices (like home energy systems that include batteries or solar panels) if it would allow them to save money in the long run."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But much like the general population, every generation was more likely to cite financial reasons for their purchasing consideration.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Home energy rebates can help consumers save money — if they know about them</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">By the end of this year, consumers will potentially be able to tap into the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>energy efficiency rebates</a> — up to $8,000 as part of the Home Efficiency Rebates Program and up to $14,000 as part of the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates Program — but the money must first jump over several hurdles. States must apply for the funding and set up programs to distribute the cash, and, more importantly, consumers have to know the discounts are available.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumers are looking for opportunities to save money, and while there are easier and cheaper ways to do so than buying a new water heater or heat pump, these kinds of incremental upgrades are the ones that will help Americans in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To make the green transition happen, states must tap into the available funding, but some — particularly GOP-led states — could reject incentives to avoid the optics of taking handouts from the federal government.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For example, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a 2024 presidential contender, has already chosen to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>turn down</a> Florida’s $377 million share of the federal funding. Republican states have taken similar stances in the past in rejecting renewable energy projects that have been deemed <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>“woke.”</a></p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The White House will also have to do its part in spreading the word, an issue that President Joe Biden <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>acknowledged</a> during a Cabinet meeting, saying that consumers “need to know how to take advantage of these benefits that we passed. That’s on all of us around the table here to make sure we get that message out clearly.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Almost 3 in 5 consumers have not heard much or anything at all about the rebates, according to the Morning Consult survey.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A successful energy efficiency campaign will rely on making consumers aware of the savings that could come with making home energy upgrades, promoting state efforts to establish accessible and impactful rebate programs, and providing education around less familiar technology like heat pumps so consumers are comfortable with what they’re purchasing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5y%2FprHNZp%2BopZViwrGz0ZqbnqtdmLyvv9SmnKtlpp6yuL8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
