However, to set the record straight, Perry didn’t own a dog during the time of his death. Sources from news outlets confirmed that the Instagram post was inaccurate. Furthermore, one Instagram account who goes by the username @falkgreta explained this fact in the comments.</p><p>“I hate to say this, but this is fake news. His dog has been in the custody of his ex girlfriend for several years, and is in no need of a new home,” the person wrote.</p><p>He was previously a dog dad to a doodle mix named Alfred, whom he shared with his ex-fiancée Molly Hurwitz. Perry posted a photo of the said dog months ahead of his separation from the literary agent.</p><p>“We all know who rules the Perry household even without the crown. You can follow my boy @alfreddoodleperry, where we’ll be sharing photos and videos, telling you about our favorite pet brands, and presenting some tips to keep our dogs safe!” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>wrote</a>.</p><p>Following Perry’s sudden death, Hurwitz wrote a heart-wrenching tribute for him. The literary manager spoke out about their time together in a lengthy post on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. According to her, “being with him as he rediscovered his brilliance was magical.” She, however, noted that he “obviously knew that man in a very different way.”</p><p>“While I loved him deeper than I could comprehend, he was complicated, and he caused pain like I’d never known,” she wrote. “No one in my adult life has had a more profound impact on me than Matthew Langford Perry. I have tremendous gratitude for that, for everything I learned from our relationship.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fellow-friends-cast-speak-out-about-his-passing>Fellow Friends Cast Speak Out About His Passing</h2><p>After the news about Perry’s death broke, the Friends cast have broken their silence about the devastating time. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Aniston</a>, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer have released a joint statement as obtained by PEOPLE.</p><p>“We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates, we are a family,” their statement read. “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.”</p><p>“In time we will say more, as and when we are able,” they continued. “For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the three co-creators of&nbsp;Friends,&nbsp;Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright, also issued a joint statement in memory of Perry.</p><p>“We are shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew’s passing. It still seems impossible. All we can say is that we feel blessed to have had him as part of our lives,” their statement read. “He was a brilliant talent. It’s a cliche to say that an actor makes a role their own, but in Matthew’s case, there are no truer words. From the day we first heard him embody the role of Chandler Bing, there was no one else for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_ScarlettJohansson_Theo-WargoGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Scarlett Johansson Is Taking Legal Action Against AI App’s Unauthorized Use of Her Image in Ad" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6KqmmWbqrGzu9ZmoKxlnqTBbq3DqKetoZ6ceq6t062fnq9dpbKzvtisZJ2nl2Kvpq%2FArqqeZZiaeqW1w6erZqCRq7Juu82eZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
