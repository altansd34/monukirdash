The singer showed her sureness when she competed on the show by only using her first name. Jurnee hoped to follow in the footsteps of such icons as Madonna, Cher, and Beyoncé. It wasn’t an easy ride for Jurnee to become a success on the singing competition, but she helped usher in representation on the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jurnee-was-born-to-sing>Jurnee Was Born to Sing</h2><p>The Tuscon, AZ, native began singing at just two years old. Jurnee would often throw talent shows and perform in front of her family. The singer’s first big performance happened when she was just 10 years old. Jurnee was a cast member in her school’s musical. The singer grew up watching American Idol with her mother and was inspired to try out for the show when she was old enough to do so.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol’ Jurnee</h2><p>The singer was persistent on her quest to become a household name. American Idol Season 16 wasn’t the first time Jurnee walked on to the singing competition show stage. Jurnee also auditioned in Season 15. The singer did not make much noise during her first season run. Jurnee was cut after Hollywood week. For her Season 16 audition Jurnee sang “Rise Up” by Andra Day.&nbsp;Katy Perry&nbsp;and&nbsp;Luke Bryan&nbsp;voted “yes”, sending her to the next round. Throughout Season 16 Jurnee garnered standing ovation after standing ovation. She was celebrated for her powerful voice and her ability to engage with the audience.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol’ Top 7</h2><p>Jurnee finished her Idol run in the Top 7. For her final song she performed “Kiss” by Prince and the Revolution as well as “Back at One” by Brian McKnight. Although Jurnee did not take home the championship she left a lasting impression on the show. The singer was unapologetic with who she was. On the show Jurnee made it known that she was proud to be a part of the LGBTQIA community. Her advocacy happened on the show and off. Jurnee spoke openly about her marriage to her wife Ashley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jurnee on Tour</h2><p>After her season Jurnee joined the American Idol Live Tour. The 40 city tour kicked-off the summer and featured fellow Idol contestants Cade Foehner, Caleb Lee Hutchinson, Catie Turner, Gabby Barrett, Maddie Poppe, as well as Michael J. Woodard. The tour also featured a special guest, Season 8 American Idol winner, Kris Allen. Unfortunately Jurnee was diagnosed with vocal nodes while on tour. The growths form on the vocal cords and can affect the singer’s voice severely.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>These days Jurnee has been secretive when it comes to new music.
