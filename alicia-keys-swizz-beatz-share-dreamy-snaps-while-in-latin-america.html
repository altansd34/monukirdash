Thus, when Keys was performing during the night, she and her Swizz Beatz are roaming around the streets of Latin America. On Instagram, the singer shared several photos of her and Beatz enjoying Chile.</p><p>“Chile, you are beautiful beyond words!!! I cannot BELIEVE the love I felt from you!!! Thank you for having me,” she wrote.</p><p>Keys began her Instagram slideshow with a photo of her smiling behind a sunset background. The last three photos then showed her silhouette snaps with Beatz as they were kissing.</p><p>A couple of days later, Keys then uploaded a series of pictures with her family as they were exploring Mexico. Such photos were taken hours before she kicks off her show in the said city.</p><p>“Mexico, you’re already taking my breath away,” she wrote. “Mexico City, I can’t wait to celebrate with you tonight!!!”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“No One” hitmaker </a>ended the Latin American leg of her World Tour in Guadalajara, Mexico last May 19.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-reimagines-if-i-ain-t-got-you-with-74-person-orchestra>She Reimagines “If I Ain’t Got You” with 74-Person Orchestra</h2><p>Weeks back, Keys took her music hit ““If I Ain’t Got You” to the 1700s. Keys has recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of the classic as well as the premiere of Queen Charlotte on Netflix.

How does this song keep doing this? I’m so grateful to you, for loving this like I do!!”</p><p>The musical project is a collaboration between Keys, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Netflix. According to the singer, the entire idea of the clip was “ambitious.”</p><p>“I feel like it’s going to open the minds of many people to realize that women of color belong everywhere and we’ve always been everywhere. It’s magical,” she said.</p><p>Overall, the clip features all women of color while they were wearing 1700s-inspired gowns from various countries such as Egypt, Barbados, South Africa, Sweden. This, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a> is the “first of its kind” all-women of color global orchestra.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_CamilaCabello_ShawnMendes_Jeff-KravitzAMA2019FilmMagic-for-dcp-220x147.jpg alt="Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes Further Spark Romance Rumors While Seen Hand In Hand in NYC" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>alicia keys</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>swizz beatz</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWgnKGRYrimxdJmqrChqq96o7HArbFmq5iWv6Z5w6ucmqWpYsCvrc%2BsZLCgmaGybrXNZqOarJmjeqK5xKugnJlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
