A new rooftop viewing deck has been installed, offering wonderful vistas of the Welsh coastline, and new flooring added in the gatehouse towers. According to <a href=#>Cadw</a>, the Welsh Government’s historic environment service that is responsible for the castle’s upkeep, the project gives the general public access to areas of the castle not seen close-up for centuries.</p><p>The work has also included the addition of a modern lift facility, which will make the castle’s upper floors accessible to wheelchair users for the first time, granting more people than ever the opportunity to poke around this once-formidable medieval stronghold.</p><p>Speaking about the redevelopment project, Dawn Bowden MS, Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, said, ‘Making our historic sites more accessible is a fantastic – and necessary – way of caring for Wales’ historical monuments for the benefit of present and future generations.’</p><p>‘Enhancement projects like this one ensures that everybody can access Welsh history and learn more about the nation’s heritage,’ she added.</p><p>Caernarfon Castle was built by the English King Edward I as part of his attempted conquest of Wales during the 13th century. With its imposing stone curtain walls, it served as the king’s de facto headquarters in Wales, and was also where Edward II, the first English Prince of Wales, was born.</p><p>Along with the castles of Beaumaris, Conwy and Harlech, it forms the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd, one of Wales’ four UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The castle’s grounds are also home to a museum dedicated to the Royal Welch Fusiliers, Wales' oldest infantry regiment, as well as two cafes – one of which was added as part of the new project.</p><p>The opening up of new parts of the castle is complemented by a new art exhibition consisting of a series of sculptures that delve into the story of the Welsh people who built these castles on behalf of the English king.</p><p>Learn more about the work Cadw carries out to ensure the protection of Wales’ historic monuments, or check out some of the other famous castles from around Wales.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmrqaZqbKlecqipaCcn6J8pK3Eq6Waqpaku26vwKyrpZ2jYr20gYymoKWkmaS7br7EnZyvnZykva6xza1krqammratscM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
