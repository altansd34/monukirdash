The report stopped short of advising in favour of compulsory quotas, however.</p><p class=heading>Best woman for the job?</p><p>Lord Davies, who led the review, spoke for change ‘to ensure that more talented and gifted women can get into the top jobs in companies across the UK’ but, he insisted that far from being a simple ‘numbers game’, there was evidence that companies who had female board members were more profitable. Norway is an example of a country in which gender quotas have <a href=#>seen by some as a ‘tentative success’</a> in getting more women into previously male-dominated leadership positions. ‘Boards cannot afford to use only half of the population's brain power’, argued then minister for business Ansgar Gabrielsen when the quotas were introduced in 2003.</p><p>However, the chairwoman of enforcement service firm <a href=#>Rossendales, Julie Green-Jones, has been among those criticising</a> the proposal for gender quotas, saying that appointments ‘should be [of] the best person for the job regardless of their gender’. There is also concern that getting companies to put more women on the board will create resentment and lead to a situation where the female director’s colleagues, and perhaps the women herself, will question her actual ability and suitability for the role. ‘I personally would feel very uncomfortable if I was in the boardroom [just] because I was a woman,’ Green-Jones added.</p><p><a href=#>See the survey details and full results</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpZGiAbrPEp5ueql2mwrDAwKxkm6qZqa6qug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
