And we&nbsp;hope you’re just as&nbsp;eager to&nbsp;learn her secret to&nbsp;longevity.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;woman that lived 122 years</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae0/937/fd00365b5e8493611d1316f89f.jpg><p>Jeanne Calment was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;Arles, <a href=# title=France data-link=tag>France</a> in&nbsp;1875. At&nbsp;that time, the life expectancy for a&nbsp;woman was 45. But Calment somehow managed to&nbsp;live almost 3&nbsp;times as&nbsp;long, and her life was anything but boring.</p><p>Calment even <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>claimed</a> that she’d <strong>met Vincent van Gogh</strong> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;paint shop where she helped her future husband when she was 13&nbsp;years old. Interestingly, he&nbsp;didn’t make a&nbsp;good impression on&nbsp;her. Calment said that <strong>he&nbsp;looked ugly, didn’t smell good, and was rude</strong>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;long life&nbsp;— a&nbsp;gift or&nbsp;a&nbsp;curse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ae/c20/c1df6a5e8a839b82737fa72a0b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1898, Calment had a&nbsp;daughter, Yvonne. Unfortunately, she died in&nbsp;1934, leaving behind a&nbsp;husband and a&nbsp;7-year-old son, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Calment</a> and her husband, Fernand, raised as&nbsp;their own. In&nbsp;1942, Calment suffered another loss&nbsp;— this time it&nbsp;was her husband. One could say her long life was a&nbsp;curse because <strong>she outlived many of&nbsp;her closest relatives</strong>. In&nbsp;1963, she lost both her grandson and her son-in-law.</p><p>In&nbsp;1988, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;112, she was<strong> recognized as&nbsp;the oldest person in&nbsp;the world</strong>. Another woman was given this title sometime later, but in&nbsp;1991, after she died, it&nbsp;went back to&nbsp;Calment. She was 116&nbsp;at that time, and she lived to&nbsp;be&nbsp;122 years old.</p><p><h2>Some poeple don’t believe it’s possible to&nbsp;live that long.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/784/71e/8c25a65e09bc0962e42b8980ed.jpg><p>It’s understandable that <strong>some people were convinced it&nbsp;wasn’t possible to&nbsp;live until such an&nbsp;old age</strong>. And there was a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;researchers who <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>confirmed</a> that Calment was indeed who she claimed to&nbsp;be. One of&nbsp;them, a&nbsp;demographer, said she was a&nbsp;“tough cookie.” Even at&nbsp;that old age, she would wake up&nbsp;at&nbsp;6:45 and do&nbsp;calisthenics.</p><p>However, there was another skeptical surge of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>interest</a> in&nbsp;Calment in&nbsp;2018. Valery Novoselov, a&nbsp;Russian geriatrician, announced that he&nbsp;<strong>wanted to&nbsp;prove that Calment was an&nbsp;imposter</strong> and that she didn’t actually live until the age of&nbsp;122. He&nbsp;shared his thoughts on&nbsp;this matter with a&nbsp;mathematician, Nikolay Zak, who agreed with him.</p><p>According to&nbsp;his calculations, <strong>it&nbsp;was very unlikely for someone to&nbsp;live 122&nbsp;years</strong>. Mathematical models created by&nbsp;other researchers showed, however, that it&nbsp;was actually not impossible to&nbsp;live to&nbsp;such an&nbsp;old age. Moreover, there were existing well-documented <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cases</a> of&nbsp;people who lived almost just as&nbsp;long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b24/088/98f5a453858286b4651478a760.jpg><p>There were certain pieces of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>evidence</a> that seemed to&nbsp;support Novoselov’s and Zak’s opinions. Or, at&nbsp;least, they interpreted them in&nbsp;their favor. Further investigations led them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;theory that the person claiming to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<strong>Jeanne Calment was actually her daughter, Yvonne</strong>.</p><p>They claimed that, as&nbsp;they believed, it&nbsp;was Jeanne Calment who died in&nbsp;1934, and her family said it&nbsp;was Yvonne to&nbsp;avoid inheritance taxes. However, <strong>this theory was disproved</strong> by&nbsp;one researcher who explained that those inheritance taxes couldn’t have financially burdened the family, so&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;reason for them to&nbsp;commit fraud.</p><p>And there were other skeptics and theories too. However, there were enough people and documents that could <strong>verify that Jeanne Calment was indeed Jeanne Calment</strong> and not anyone else and that she lived 122&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>Her personality is&nbsp;something to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ef/2d1/42ff1a590a89f647ad25730057.jpg><p>One might expect someone who’s lived as&nbsp;long a&nbsp;life as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Jeanne</a>, who’s had to&nbsp;witness the deaths of&nbsp;her loved ones, to&nbsp;become reserved and maybe even cynical or&nbsp;grouchy. But that wasn’t Jeanne Calment.</p><p>When she turned 100, she walked to&nbsp;the houses of&nbsp;every person in&nbsp;Arles who wished her a&nbsp;happy birthday to&nbsp;thank them. And <strong>she didn’t lose her spirit later in&nbsp;life</strong> either. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;120, she told reporters, “I&nbsp;see badly, I&nbsp;hear badly, I&nbsp;can’t feel anything, but everything’s fine.” She continued, “I&nbsp;waited 110 years to&nbsp;get famous. I&nbsp;intend to&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;it.”</p><p>As&nbsp;for <strong>how she managed to&nbsp;live that long</strong>, no&nbsp;one actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>knows</a>. She herself believed <strong>it&nbsp;was thanks to&nbsp;laughter and olive oil</strong>. Others believed it&nbsp;was due to&nbsp;her sugar-rich diet&nbsp;— she would eat 2&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;chocolate a&nbsp;week and had dessert with every meal. And one medical researcher suggested it&nbsp;was because she was “immune to&nbsp;stress.”</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think 122 years is&nbsp;too long a&nbsp;life or&nbsp;would you like to&nbsp;live just as&nbsp;long? Do&nbsp;you know anyone personally who’s just as&nbsp;old?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nToZxmr5%2BnuaW%2FjKijnZ2jqXqxsdGspqdlp528brnErWSvoZ6Ysq%2FAjK%2BYp2WXpLSpecCnm2arkZ6xbr%2FHnmSdoZSjwW64yKScZqCZonp5fJJrbHJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
