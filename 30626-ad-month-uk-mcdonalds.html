However the video has been also used as part of promotions to advertise the return of McDonald’s Drive Through after their temporary closure due to COVID-19 on June 4th, as well as the return of McDelivery.</p><p>Looking at a two week moving average throughout June, McDonald’s Ad Awareness score (which asks whether someone has seen or heard an advert by the company in the past two weeks) rose to a peak of 35.1%, up from 17.7% at the end of May.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/UK20Ad20of20the20Month20-20McDonalds.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Previously we wrote about how news of McDonald’s reopening had got Britons excited and prompted an instant change in our brand tracking metrics for the chain – and that excitement has carried through to June.

Across June, Word of mouth Exposure score among British adults who eat more than one takeaway a month were significantly higher than those of the general public, remaining on average 14.6 percentage points higher.</p><p>Consideration scores (whether someone would consider purchasing from the brand in future) were also higher among British adults eating frequent takeaways, remaining on average 14.3 percentage points higher than the general public suggesting McDonalds drive through takeaways and the return of McDelivery have proved popular while diners wait for the restaurants themselves to open.</p><p><strong>Learn more about <a href=#>YouGov BrandIndex here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2WDc4KMmptmpZ%2Bjwal51KRkppuUpLuiuMOs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
