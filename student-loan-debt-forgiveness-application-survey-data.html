In the case of the loan forgiveness program, he said that when borrowers reached out to servicers with questions about eligibility, “our answer has to be, ‘I don't know if you're eligible, because I haven't seen the details of the program yet.’” Buchanan maintained that servicers may be providing correct information but it’s “not what the borrower wants to hear.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Oftentimes, that perception is that we're preventing them to access things, when in fact, the reality is we're enforcing the law,” Buchanan said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Federal student loan borrowers were asked in the Morning Consult survey about their experiences working with servicers, and a third said that communication with them has been unclear. Roughly equal shares said contacting servicers and getting help from them is not easy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOrKuunJWjwW64zpqlZpyVl8Fuss6rnqKulaOytL%2BMmqeppJmYrrW1zqdkrK2iq7K6ecOaq5o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
