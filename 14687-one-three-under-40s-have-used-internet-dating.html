Rather than saying the trend had shifted the focus to superficial, short-term relationships (18% said this), more people (34%) said it had enabled millions of people who would never have met to get together.</p><p class="live-survey-results hidden">LIVE SURVEY RESULTS</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/datingUse.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>New YouGov research reveals the scale of the phenomenon in Britain.
