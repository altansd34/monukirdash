After a year of economic and industry turmoil, financial services providers will look to break out of stagnation by using new technology to improve efficiency, bolster safety and reach new user demographics next year. Read on for my predictions for how financial institutions will approach 2024.
BNPL providers self-regulate as government action looms Though the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) signaled intent to regulate the buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry in September 2022, considerable action hasn’t yet followed in the United States."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on for my predictions for how financial institutions will approach 2024.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>BNPL providers self-regulate as government action looms</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) signaled intent to regulate the buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry in September 2022, considerable action hasn’t yet followed in the United States. Providers, which are already behaving as if regulation is on the horizon, are likely to beat out government mandates with in-house consumer protection initiatives next year.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s likely this regulation will center around consumer protection based on the CFPB’s initial assessment. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which supervises banks, has already issued guidance to banks offering BNPL, urging them to limit “adverse consumer outcomes,” for example. New operational requirements could combat a pervasive issue in the industry: A large group of BNPL users are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>struggling financially</a>, posting higher rates of debt across the board and lower financial well-being index scores than adults overall. These challenges are also reflected in data from the New York Federal Reserve and Wells Fargo.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">&nbsp;Regulation that aims to make BNPL safer for consumers could have two impacts on the industry:</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>1. Increased use. </strong>While BNPL spend is on the rise, the share of consumers using the technology monthly has hovered around 1 in 5. And frequency of use remains roughly consistent. Increased transparency or new safeguards that limit the risk of default could entice customers to use the tech more regularly, in turn accelerating stickiness providers are already seeing.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong>2. New user groups.</strong> BNPL users skew younger and underbanked. New regulations could ease concerns among less-penetrated demographics, in turn bringing them into the fold. It could also open the door for new providers — like banks — which might be more appealing to these groups, to bolster installment offerings.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Banks start rolling out more consumer-facing generative AI</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Financial institutions have long-employed artificial intelligence and machine learning for back-office use cases. But many consumers <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>aren’t aware</a> of this, and say they prefer to use financial institutions that don’t use the technology. After generative AI’s<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> breakout 2023</a>, it’s likely that financial institutions will begin pushing the technology toward more consumer-facing use cases.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Banks and credit unions are likely to be first adopters, which is a good thing for the industry. Consumers trust these sectors of financial institutions <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>most overall</a> (67% and 66%, respectively), giving them capital they can leverage to unveil new technology. This trust is reflected in sentiments related to AI: Consumers trust banks and credit unions to use AI far more than any other category of financial institution. First-line features will likely include customer service chatbots, which are already underway at banks like JPMorgan Chase and NatWest, and face higher levels of consumer receptivity than other technology.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If these rollouts are successful, banks could substantially improve the digital banking experience. Over half (52%) of consumers already interact with their banks mostly digitally, and an additional 19% use digital sometimes. An improved experience could tighten relationships with consumers in ways that grow engagement and eliminate churn.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The “finfluencer” economy takes off</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Influencers</a> are hugely popular with social media users: Over half (54%) of consumers who use social media say they follow influencers. But there’s a hole in the sector for financial advice, and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>“finfluencers”</a> like Farnoosh Torabi and John Liang, who provide financial management advice and tips, are booming on social platforms, setting the scene for a flurry of new content (and new partnerships) in the year to come.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There’s already an appetite for this content among Gen Z adults, who are likelier than other generations to follow influencers in general. And they’re also more likely to be actively seeking out financial advice than they were a few years ago: The share of Gen Zers who said they did not consume any financial advice fell from 63% in November 2021 to 46% in November 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As this generation ages, money tips will become increasingly important. But where Gen Zers get advice from is likely to look different than older generations. Nearly a third (31%) of Gen Zers said they sought financial advice from social media in November 2023 — the top category outside friends and family. For context, this is nearly double the share of U.S. adults overall, and one of the highest rates of any demographic. That appetite should translate into more creator content that focuses on financial advice, and more engagement.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There’s also vast opportunity for financial institutions, who at times stay away from social media platforms, to partner with finfluencers. Financial institutions that are trying to win over the near-quarter of Gen Zers who are <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>weighing</a> opening new accounts may look to TikTok and Instagram in search of reaching them through virality, replicating the bump seen by brands like NYX and Dollar General this year. Celebrities could be in on it too: Zelle, for example, just tapped Christina Ricci for an anti-fraud campaign. But the rise of influencers could also have unexpected implications, because viral videos could also contribute to spreading doom and gloom that shifts financial goals or erodes Gen Zers’ already volatile financial well-being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX2d9c4CMn6CnmZ6YtqK4jKycq66ZmLK0edOrnKecow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
