Synthetic extensions are added to the natural hair beyond the start of your hairline to create an illusion of naturally thick braids.</p><h3>12. The ombre look</h3><p class=align-left>The ombre look plays around with the shade of hair extensions, which gradually graduate from the darkest shade to the lightest. It is the in-thing in 2024, especially among females in their teen and early adulthood years.</p><h3>13. Cornrows with curls</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/650483b2b27281cd.jpg><p class=align-left>Who said that you cannot combine cornrows with curls? A good stylist can help you combine the two to create a stunning look. This is a versatile style that can be adjusted to suit the shape of your face. The curls can also be made using natural hair or curly extensions.</p><h3>14. Zigzag cornrows</h3><p class=align-left>These are a great variation of traditional cornrows. Instead of hair being in straight lines, it is sectioned in a zigzag manner. The result is fantastic; both men and women can wear these cornrows.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d10261059b1b98f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to hide bra strap under mono sleeve dress: Fashionista shares impressive hack</span></p></a><h3>15.

It creates a beautiful stitch-like pattern that is eye-catching.</p><h3>16. Chic super-jumbo cornrows</h3><p class=align-left>Are you tired of regular thin or medium-size cornrows? Very thick ones are a great and welcome change. Beware! You will require many more extensions to achieve this look, and they may feel a little heavier than usual.</p><h3>17. The snaky look</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/931c07935178704b.jpg><p class=align-left>This intricate design requires patience and expertise to create. It resembles a meandering snake hence the name.</p><h3>18. Chunky and gorgeous</h3><p class=align-left>This look is ideal for people who love wearing braids but hate undoing them. Hair is sectioned into several large sections using a larger-than-normal amount of extensions to make each one thick. Although this look is gorgeous, it tends to unravel or become shaggy after a short period.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4b811dc5077588cc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Style pick of the week: 9 beautiful ladies dazzle in fabulous ankara dresses</span></p></a><h3>19.

Loopy Ghana cornrows</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dab7a3d67d6a0348.jpg><p class=align-left>Getting looped cornrows will make your friends envy you.

It is important to know the shape of your face before styling your hair. You can use various coloured braids or simply black ones.</p><h3>23.

The curls add more beauty, and the shoulder-length braids are just ideal for any given occasion.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9133930475f7528e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Modest styles for church: 7 beautiful ways to look elegant in ankara fashion on Sundays</span></p></a><h3>24. Braids with beads</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b83b0ba665406841.jpg><p class=align-left>For a more subtle look, try black braids with clear beads. They provide a stylish and girly appearance, while the clear beads add a touch of sparkle to the style.</p><h3>25. Thin cornrows</h3><p class=align-left>This is a great alternative to the medium and thick cornrows that many African women wear. Thin cornrows are best for women with long natural hair because extensions tend to thicken the braids.</p><h3>26. The rainbow look</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b5b5cdf0d4ebcdf6.jpg><p class=align-left>This look will make heads turn wherever you go.

The hair is divided into small sections, and thin extensions are added to achieve this look. You will spend a few more hours at the salon for this look.</p><h3>28. Curly twists</h3><p class=align-left>Curly twists are similar to micro-twists, only that curly hair extensions are used and done in medium sizes. You can always choose different-coloured hair extensions, depending on your preference. This is one of the short braid styles that can serve you for a while without getting damaged.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/513a1da36346d07f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 trending Ankara kimono styles: find a perfect design for you</span></p></a><h3>29.

You will need more extensions like any other jumbo style, but the result is to die for.</p><h3>30.
