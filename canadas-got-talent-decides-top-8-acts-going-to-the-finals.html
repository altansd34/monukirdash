The Top 8 was decided by the judges and the viewers at home.

Judge Howie Mandel loved it, calling it the “most exciting thing I have seen this season.”</p><p>He described Mark as a “rule breaker,” so it was fitting that he himself decided to break the rules by hitting the Golden Buzzer to send him straight to the Finals and give him $25,000, courtesy of CIBC. But Mark wasn’t the only contestant to earn the honor.</p><p>Singer Natalie Morris delivered a stunning performance of “I Was Here” by Beyoncé, receiving a standing ovation. Mandel consulted with the producers and his fellow judges, and they decided to hit a surprise Golden Buzzer for her. Natalie will go straight to the finale and receive $25,000.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘CANADA’S GOT TALENT’ DECIDES TOP 14 ACTS AS AUDITIONS WRAP UP</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-acts-made-it-into-the-top-8>Which Acts Made It into the Top 8?</h2><p>Tuesday’s Golden Buzzer recipients Natalie Morris and Mark Clearview automatically earned a spot in the Top 8 contestants on Tuesday night. The judges also chose four other acts to go into the Finals for a chance to win the $1 million grand prize, courtesy of Rogers.</p><p>Those acts were dance duo Funkanometry, comedian Travis Lindsay, stunt duo Mat & Mym, and singer Rebecca Strong. Four other acts were eliminated, and four were sent to a public vote. Viewers chose which two acts they wanted to see in the finale.</p><p>On Thursday, the two chosen acts were revealed on Breakfast Television — singer Eshan Sobti and comedian Sterling V. Scott. Upon hearing the good news, an emotional Eshan shared that he “couldn’t go to sleep” as he awaited the results. Sterling joked that he was “super grateful to everyone I annoyed, text messaged and hounded” about voting for him.</p><p>The Season 3 finale will air next Tuesday, May 14, at 8 pm ET/5 pm PT on Citytv and Citytv+.
