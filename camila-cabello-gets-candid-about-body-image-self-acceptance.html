Whether it’s being on social media or having access to it. There are times in my life where I really, truly forget I’m in the public eye, even though I am. And then months later, I’ll rejoin social media and be like, ‘Oh, they got all these terrible pictures of me,'” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cabello</a> went on to state that she does the same when dealing with body image issues. As per the singer, she’s had “healthy times” where her weight fluctuated, and she just maintained a “whatever” attitude. However, there were also moments where she felt “exposed” and “vulnerable,” and this is when pressure kicks in.</p><p>“I think for me, there just has to be a line that you draw where you say, ‘I have to take care of myself’ and everything is cool within the frame of my integrity without betraying myself,” she said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, the singer also talked about how she managed to overcome her anxiety. Cabello particularly credits her improvement to therapy. She acknowledges that her mental health stability used to be “much worse” when she was younger. The pop star also noted that she feels “a lot better now” and is out of her previous “rough mental-health patch.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-talks-missing-camaraderie-of-being-in-a-band>She Talks Missing Camaraderie of Being in a Band</h2><p>Back in December 2016, Cabello shocked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fifth Harmony</a> fans when she announced that she was leaving the girl group. Since then, she’s pursued a considerably successful career as a solo artist. The pop star has managed to release three studio albums, dropping hits like “Havana” and “Never Be the Same.”</p><p>Nonetheless, while she works as a solo artist now, she still banks on the spirit of camaraderie. According to Cabello, she’s manifested mutual trust with the people behind her music.</p><p>“Music is just such a collaborative process,” she said. “I am writing things, but other people are playing instruments and other people are feeding off of my melodies and I’m feeding off of their chords. So honestly, it feels really collaborative in a nice, healthy way.”</p><p>At the moment, Cabello is working on her new album. When asked what lyrics is she most proud of so far, the singer said she can only choose from the song she’s already released.</p><p>“There are lyrics I can’t say while they’re unreleased. But from songs that are released, I really like my song ‘In the Dark.’ That’s one of my favorite songs of mine, the whole song,” she said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_LukeBryan_ABC_Connie-Chornuk-220x147.jpg alt="Luke Bryan Details “Intimate” Las Vegas Residency: “It’s Been Amazing”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>camila cabello</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqkoqSRYrCirsSlo6hll5rBtHnCmqWdoZRirqO71K1km6eUrnqqucCgnGarlaGzbq3CnJyprJGjsKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
