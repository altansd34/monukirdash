The singer was considered a frontrunner for Best Actress for her portrayal of the queen of soul, Aretha Franklin. Respect premiered during the summer of 2021, after being postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The film grossed $31 million at the box office and earned positive reviews for Hudson.</strong></p><p>The actress could have made history at the award show this year. Fans hoped that she would be nominated for Best Actress and Best Original Song. If that had happened, Hudson would have been the first Black actress to be nominated in three separate categories.</p><p>The <a href=#>American Idol</a> alum won her first Oscar in 2007 for her role as Effie White in Dreamgirls. The movie catapulted Hudson’s career after she lost Season 3 of Idol. In fact, being on Idol first set Hudson on her journey to play Franklin. The Grammy award winning singer performed Franklin’s 1970’s hit “Share Your Love With Me,” for her audition. Hudson was later hand selected by Franklin to play her in the film.</p><p>Jessica Chastain, Olivia Colman, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, as well as Kristen Stewart all beat out Hudson for a nomination. The Academy Awards will air on ABC this coming March.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-no-respect-for-ego-winner-jennifer-hudson>No Respect For EGO Winner Jennifer Hudson</h2><p>This is not the first time fans felt as though Hudson was snubbed from an awards ceremony. Insiders believed she was a shoo-in for this year’s Golden Globes, but she was not nominated. Hudson famously called out the Tony awards in 2016 after she was left off the list for her role in The Color Purple Musical. She felt as though she was used for her celebrity and not her talent.</p><p>Oscar voters have a history of not recognizing films that were released early in the season. The pandemic and the summer 2021 release could have been a factor as to why Hudson wasn’t nominated despite the fact that she has won numerous awards for her role already this season.</p><p>Fans should not worry about Hudson. Her career continues to flourish. She recently won a Daytime Emmy and is one step closer to joining the elite EGOT group.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-08-at-10.10.57-AM-1.png alt="David Archuleta Postpones Concert Due to Strained Vocal Chords" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jennifer hudson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp6GWmr9utNSdqqimXai1sK%2FKoqWgpKliwK%2FBwZucnWWRqXq1tMisZLKdkafAbrvSnJirq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
