This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a> made&nbsp;us wonder... What matters more: love and loyalty to&nbsp;family or&nbsp;personal growth?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/427/0d2/a1f2bb52729bb92555660f518e.jpg><p>My&nbsp;mom and&nbsp;I moved out of&nbsp;our house and into an&nbsp;apartment, while my&nbsp;dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my&nbsp;twin brothers.</p><p>My&nbsp;mom was devastated, but she quickly picked herself up&nbsp;for the two of&nbsp;us. She went back to&nbsp;school, and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she continued climbing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. My&nbsp;mom adjusted better to&nbsp;going from a&nbsp;double-income household to&nbsp;a&nbsp;single income and was able to&nbsp;contribute a&nbsp;substantial amount of&nbsp;money to&nbsp;my&nbsp;college fund.</p><p>My&nbsp;dad, on&nbsp;the other hand, had a&nbsp;harder time as&nbsp;he&nbsp;now had to&nbsp;support a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;four on&nbsp;a&nbsp;single income as&nbsp;his wife was a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom. My&nbsp;dad did not have much disposable income and did not contribute as&nbsp;much to&nbsp;the fund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9bc/217/08214a527c885f45f8d31a4a33.jpg><p>Unfortunately, my&nbsp;10-year-old stepbrother was diagnosed with kidney disease and must undergo dialysis. My&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;drowning in&nbsp;medical debt, so&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom agreed that he&nbsp;should no&nbsp;longer pay my&nbsp;child support.</p><p>The specialist suggested a&nbsp;different treatment for my&nbsp;brother, as&nbsp;most other treatments did not help or&nbsp;stopped working, and they are running out of&nbsp;options before a&nbsp;transplant (not feasible at&nbsp;this time). This treatment is&nbsp;not covered by&nbsp;insurance and costs a&nbsp;lot. My&nbsp;dad can’t borrow money because of&nbsp;his debts.</p><p>My&nbsp;dad got a&nbsp;second job on&nbsp;weekends, and his wife homeschools the kids and takes care of&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother full-time. My&nbsp;dad’s family disowned him when they found out he&nbsp;had cheated on&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother. Still, he&nbsp;got some help from his brother and sister, but they can only help a&nbsp;little. His wife doesn’t have much family, so&nbsp;I think coming to&nbsp;me&nbsp;was his last option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/655/b91/9d837c5c108a97f4715660418d.jpg><p>I&nbsp;really don’t want to&nbsp;give them the money because&nbsp;I know that if&nbsp;I don’t get any scholarships, then&nbsp;I won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the college&nbsp;I want without going into debt. My&nbsp;future would be&nbsp;at&nbsp;risk and&nbsp;I know my&nbsp;dad won’t help&nbsp;me. So, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;call my&nbsp;mom.</p><p>She got off work early and picked me&nbsp;up&nbsp;at&nbsp;Dad’s house. She took me&nbsp;out for <a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a> and&nbsp;I explained what happened. After talking a&nbsp;bit, she said&nbsp;I could keep the fund and not give the money to&nbsp;Dad, or&nbsp;we&nbsp;can take the money Dad contributed all these years and give it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;him. I&nbsp;told her&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;give Dad back the money.</p><p>After we&nbsp;finished our coffee, Mom withdrew the exact amount Dad had put in&nbsp;over the years, and she also matched the amount and added it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dad.</p><p>I&nbsp;waited in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> while she gave Dad the money, and he&nbsp;was upset because the money was not enough. Mom told him that’s all he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;get from&nbsp;us and threatened to&nbsp;take him to&nbsp;court if&nbsp;he&nbsp;and his wife continued to&nbsp;disturb&nbsp;me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76b/601/82d54f583088f1a07175326b84.jpg><p>Lastly, I&nbsp;would feel bad if&nbsp;something happened to&nbsp;my&nbsp;brother —he is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;little boy— but&nbsp;I would like to&nbsp;help him with MY&nbsp;OWN money, and&nbsp;I can only do&nbsp;that if&nbsp;I start my&nbsp;career debt free. I&nbsp;also don’t want to&nbsp;risk my&nbsp;future.</p><p>While lending money to&nbsp;family members is&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal choice, <a href=#>these 16&nbsp;stories</a> show that it&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;the best idea.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecOam2avkaPBtHnMnmStp12orrexjKawZqukmr2jvs6tn56qo2K5qrLEZpmurF2eeqW7za1ksJmeqXq1u4xxaG1tY2d8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
