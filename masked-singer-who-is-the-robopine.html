One contestant even changed his name: from Porcupine to Robpine! He’s got an epic look, with a robotic eye, but an even more epic voice. This Robopine’s got TALENT!</strong></p><p>But who is The Masked Singer Robopine? A famous singer or a celebrity known for other talents? Let’s take a deep dive into the clues and who could be under the mask!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clues-on-the-masked-singer-season-5>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 5</h4><p>Cluedle-doo’s hint as Robopine was walking out said he’s “skilled at not becoming roadkill.” The first clue package for Robopine opened looking like the Matrix, with 1’s and 0’s all over the screen. Text reads “ROBOPINE…ENGAGED.” He starts, “where I came from, I was forced to grow thick quills.” One of the men in black is seen drinking from a can. He claims he was forced to fend for himself, and puts a key into a lock. So he went on a mission to “get on Hollywood’s radar.” A spaceship is shown flying into a city with prominent DNA strands on two buildings.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>Robopine says he “used 411 day and night just to make a connection…until a certain angel said ‘Hello.'” And “that random call changed everything!” A small figurine of George Washington appears on the screen then a hologram of The Masked Singer logo. Now, he was on his next mission. After his performance, he also mentioned having kids and grandkids and being 60 years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf65NtvBYy0</p>The Masked Singer Robopine clues and performance from the Season 5 Premiere</figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-popular-guesses-for-the-masked-singer-robopine>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Robopine</h4><p>The panelists did not believe that he was 60 and a grandparent based on his moves. They have predicted he’s Idris Elba, Donald Glover, Jamie Foxx, Lionel Richie, or Genuwine. Online, people are skeptical about his age too. Guesses have included Tyrese Gibson, Eddie Murphy, Damon Wayans, Denzel Washington, and Christopher Jackson from Hamilton.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-robopine-on-the-masked-singer>Who is the Robopine on The Masked Singer?</h2><p>After going through all the clues, this has been the toughest one to decode from the season 5 premiere. But finally, we landed on the most likely candidate. So based on our investigation, the Robopine is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p><strong>Actor and singer, Tyrese Gibson!</strong></p><p>And (most) of the clues point to him too! We, like the judges, had to put aside the fact that he said he’s 60 and has grandchildren. The way they immediately doubted it and said he could be lying prove to us that he probably is.</p><p>But let’s break down all the clues that prove Tyrese Gibson is The Masked Singer Robopine! First of all, the Matrix clues could be a nod to his dog, named Matrix. Talking about a difficult upbringing, Tyrese was raised by a single mother in a neighborhood in South Los Angeles known for being a low-income, high-crime area with gang activity. The many “electric” things going on throughout the clues allude to the neighborhood, named Watts.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>WATCH: <a href=#>OUR RECAP OF THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 PREMIERE + THE RACCOON IS EXPOSED!</a></strong></p><p>When the men in black drank from a can, that could be hinting at the Coca-Cola commercial that started his career. The call from an “angel” is probably referencing John Singleton, the director who cast Tyrese in his first movie ever, Baby Boy. That began a whole new career for Tyrese! But sadly, John Singleton passed away last year, which is why he could be referencing him as an angel. Lastly, Cluedle-doo’s hint that he’s “skilled at not becoming roadkill” is an obvious nod to Tyrese’s role in the Fast & Furious franchise.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-the-masked-singer-robopine-tyrese>Is The Masked Singer Robopine Tyrese?</h4><p id=h-if-his-claims-that-he-s-60-and-a-grandparent-are-true-then-the-most-likely-options-are-that-robopine-is-damon-wayans-eddie-murphy-or-laurence-fishburne-but-we-re-still-sticking-with-tyrese-gibson-as-our-guess>If his claims that he’s 60 and a grandparent are true, then the most likely options are that Robopine is Damon Wayans, Eddie Murphy, or Laurence Fishburne. But we’re still sticking with Tyrese Gibson as our guess and saying he’s under the mask. The voice is just too similar to his!</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FOR MORE CLUES DECODED: <a href=#>RUSSIAN DOLLS</a> | <a href=#>SEASHELL</a> | <a href=#>RACCOON</a></strong></p><p>Do you agree with our prediction?
