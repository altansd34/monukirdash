But recently, Germany has become known for its outstanding quality of life, and increasing numbers of people are moving there to experience its high standard of living. But what makes life in Germany so amazing? Is it job security, healthcare, safety or proximity to nature? For some, it’s all of the above!&nbsp; Here is why Germany’s quality of life is so good.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Germany-and-the-OECD-Better-Life-Index>Germany and the OECD Better Life Index</h2><p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Life Index</a> gauges the well-being of people in different countries based on various factors, ranging from housing to environmental quality. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany’s quality of life ranking</a> indicates a high standard of living and good overall well-being for its residents.</p><p>Germany scores above average in many areas of the Better Life Index, including work-life balance, environmental quality and safety.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Education,-jobs-and-work-life-balance>Education, jobs and work-life balance</h2><p>Germany is renowned for its strong economic performance, which is reflected in the Better Life Index statistics. Employment is high, with around 77% of people aged 15 to 64 in Germany working a paid job (the OECD employment average is 66%). Germans also enjoy a relatively high amount of disposable income; at $38,972 per year, it’s higher than the OECD average.</p><p>This is all balanced on top of an excellent education system, with 86% of adults ages 25 to 64 having completed secondary education. Germany topped the world education rankings in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a> thanks to its high literacy rate, focus on innovation and concentration on practical skills.&nbsp;</p><p>The country is also highly regarded for offering employees a good <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">work-life balance</a>. Workers in Germany get a minimum of 20 days of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paid holiday leave</a> per year and can work a maximum of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eight hours</a> per day (with certain exceptions).&nbsp;</p><p>However, it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not all rosy in Germany</a> in terms of work-life balance. A 2022 survey of four countries revealed that people in Germany work longer hours and have less free time than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Poland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Health-and-safety>Health and safety</h2><p>The healthcare system in Germany is generally excellent. Health insurance is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mandatory</a>, ensuring almost universal coverage, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">life expectancy</a> in the country is just over 81 years, which is average in the OECD. Meanwhile, air pollution in Germany is lower than the OECD average.&nbsp;</p><p>Germany is also considered a relatively safe place to live. In 2023, it ranked 15 out of 163 countries on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Peace Index</a>. <a href=#>Homicide rates</a> in Germany are low, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over three-quarters</a> of Germans report feeling safe walking the streets alone at night.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Society-and-lifestyle>Society and lifestyle</h2><p>Money, jobs, health and safety are all critical factors contributing to quality of life. But social and lifestyle factors also matter.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, Germans have a reasonably strong support network. 90% of people in Germany say they have someone to turn to in times of need, putting Germany in line with the OECD average.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to lifestyle, Germany is a diverse country with a decades-long history of welcoming people from all over the world. This has resulted in a multicultural society that celebrates a variety of traditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are a few <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common factors</a> Germans tend to share. Many Germans enjoy traveling internationally, with Germany spending more per capita on foreign travel than any other country in Europe. Staying active is also important to many Germans, with one-third belonging to a sports club or organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Quality-of-life:-Germany-vs.-USA>Quality of life: Germany vs. USA</h2><p>A quick internet search will bring up tons of articles and videos comparing the quality of life in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany versus the United States of America</a>. Usually, the conclusion is that Germany has a better quality of life than the US. That certainly rings true in many areas. Germany’s policies on paid holiday leave, sick leave and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">parental leave</a> are all generous compared to the US.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of safety, Germany comes out on top again. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US homicide rate</a> in 2021 was 7 per 100,000 people compared to Germany’s 1 per 100,000 people. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gun violence</a> is rare in Germany, and healthcare is far more reasonably priced.&nbsp;</p><p>But this may not tell the whole story. On the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Life Index</a>, the US scores better than Germany in terms of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">educational attainment</a>, disposable income and air pollution levels.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Best-cities-in-Germany-for-quality-of-life>Best cities in Germany for quality of life</h2><p>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mercer’s Quality of Living Survey</a>, Munich ranked as the best place to live in Germany. It is the safest large city in Germany and offers a wealth of economic opportunities. Almost 40% of Munich’s population has a non-German background, so people who move to the city from outside Germany won’t feel out of place — even if they don’t speak <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German</a>.</p><p>Other German cities to make it into Mercer’s top ten were Düsseldorf and Frankfurt. Both have strong economies, and Frankfurt was ranked as the city with the best infrastructure in the world!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Experience a high quality of life in Germany</h2><p>For those considering a move, Germany’s high quality of life is attractive. The range of job opportunities and high salaries mean that people can generally find sound footing economically. Add to that excellent public healthcare, a decent work-life balance and a population that feels safe, and Germany is a very attractive destination indeed.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
