He has been pursuing a comedy career for 8 years. As a child, he would stay up late to watch comedy on television. It’s how he first saw <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel.</a> Now, at 27 years old, everything has come full circle as Cam auditions for AGT in front of Mandel.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-bertrand-leaves-the-agt-judges-full-of-laughter-during-season-16-audition>Cam Bertrand Leaves the ‘AGT’ Judges Full of Laughter During Season 16 Audition</h2><p>For his big AGT audition, Cam performed a bit about getting older but still having a baby face. One of the problems he has run into is buying alcohol and not having the store clerk believe he is of age. The AGT judges were hysterically laughing throughout the act. Making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> laugh along with you is no small feat. Just based on their reactions to Cam’s jokes, he will for sure be voted into the next round of the competition.</p><p>Cam dropped out of college at FAMU to pursue a full-time comedy career. Taking his act to AGT after years of successfully performing all over the U.S. has proven to be the best decision for him.</p><p>“There is no better feeling than a room full of complete strangers letting you know you’re on the right path,” he wrote on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-has-conquered-comedy-stages-all-over-the-u-s>Cam Has Conquered Comedy Stages All Over the U.S.</h2><p>At the start of his career, Cam got to meet some huge comedy legends as he began performing on local stages. He met <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Steve-O</a>, John Mulaney, Jeff Dye, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Hannibal Buress</a>, and performed in front of Pete Davidson. In 2016, Cam had the honor of performing at the legendary comedy club<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link> Dangerfield’s.</a> He even got to do a sketch with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Metta World Peace.</a></p><p>Cam was a contributing writer on Seasons 11 and 12 of MTV’s Wild&nbsp;‘N Out. Former AGT host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Cannon</a> serves as the host of this hit show. Cam also became the youngest comic to win Florida’s Funniest competition where he beat out over 300 comics. Daniel Tosh and Bert Kreischer have both won this award in the past, setting Cam up for huge things to come.</p><p>Cam is the youngest comedian to record his own half-hour DryBar Comedy Special. He promoted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Sophisticated Ignorance</a> on iHeartRadio. The special has over 70 million total views since it was released. Cam has already worked with some big names in comedy including Mike Epps and Joe Rogan. AGT is going to give him even more exposure and open doors to work with even more celebrities.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-_8v6HBsi/</p></figure><p>Conquering the stages of some of the most prominent comedy clubs isn’t all. Cam also has amassed 791,000 followers on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> where he posts clips from his shows. All of this has led up to him winning the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>2020 Best of the Bay Awards</a> for Best Stand-up Comedian, Critics Pick, and Readers Pick. This year Cam started his own podcast this year called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hey, Let’s Complain</a> available on all streaming platforms.</p><p>To see Cam’s full AGT audition, tune in at 8 p.m. ET on NBC on Tuesday.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Thumbnail_PhotoByRodinEckenroth-alyssascott_GettyImages-Instagram_v2.jpeg alt="Nick Cannon Welcomes 7th Child Less Than a Month After Birth of Twins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqkZpqVp8Gzrc2dZKaZm5rAbsDHnmSan6Rit7awxp6qZqSRqrSpedSnmqimpKe8rbjAm6OyZaeewal5wqiknpypYq6kwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
