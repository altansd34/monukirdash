Nigerian Tribune reported that the police locked the church, dismissed the members, and took some of the elders to the station for interrogation.</p><p class=align-left>A church member, who pleaded anonymity, expressed displeasure over the conflict, saying that there had been a rift among the church elders concerning the decision to separate from their headquarters in the United States.</p><p class=align-left>The member added that the conflict arose from the church headquarters legalizing practices that are foreign to Nigeria’s culture.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking further, the member noted that some other members approved of the move, while others countered it, and this created a faction within the church.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img
