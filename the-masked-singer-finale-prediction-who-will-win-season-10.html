All four finalists will be unmasked, but only one of them will win the Golden Mask trophy. Who will it be?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-s-competing-in-the-masked-singer-season-10-finale>Who’s Competing in The Masked Singer Season 10 Finale?</h2><p>There are four contestants left in the Season 10 competition — the winners of Group A, B, and C, as well as the recipient of the “Ding Dong, Keep It On” Bell. All four finalists have shown off amazing performances throughout the season.</p><p>During the Group A Finals, Cow earned a spot in the finale. They’ve delivered some incredible performances this season, singing songs such as “Treasure” by Bruno Mars and “Cry Me a River” by Justin Timberlake. They’ve also shown off an infectious stage presence.</p><p>Also during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Group A Finals</a>, panelist Ken Jeong hit the “Ding Dong, Keep It On” Bell to keep Gazelle in he competition. They’ve performed songs such as “Lucky” by Britney Spears and “On the Radio” by Donna Summer. Gazelle has also shown off a sweet personality when interacting with the panel.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Group B Finals</a>, Sea Queen was chosen to move on to the finale after starting the competition as a wildcard. The judges have sensed that an iconic singer is performing under the mask, bringing their unique voice to songs such as “Love Potion No. 9” by The Searchers and “To Be with You” by Mr. Big.</p><p>Last but not least is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Group C winner</a> Donut, who has shown off a classic voice on songs like “Hooked on a Feeling” by Blue Suede and “Georgia on My Mind” by Ray Charles. Donut has brought powerful emotion to their performances.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EVERYTHING YOU MISSED ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ HOLIDAY SING-ALONG</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-will-be-named-the-winner>Who Will Be Named the Winner?</h3><p>All four finalists are obviously talented and charismatic, but only one of them can be named the winner of The Masked Singer Season 10. I believe that winner will be Cow. Not only have they shown off an impressive voice, but they bring an incredible energy to the stage with each performance.</p><p>Just look at the preview clip the show shared ahead of Wednesday’s finale episode. Cow performs “Rhythm Nation” by Janet Jackson, showing off some seriously smooth dance moves that stun the panelists.</p><p>Do you agree with the prediction that Cow will win Season 10 of the show?
