The judges then had to decide which of the remaining two acts should join him.

Shoji competed on the show earlier this year, and he shared that he looks up to former AGT winner Shin Lim.</p><p>Since Lim was a guest performer on last week’s results show, he took the time to hang out with Shoji, telling him, “I’ve seen some of your videos, and you are amazing.” Shoji couldn’t believe he was actually talking to his idol, asking, “Are you real?”</p><p>Shoji also got to watch Lim rehearse for his performance on the show, and Lim surprised him with tickets to Universal Studios for his birthday.
