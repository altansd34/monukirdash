Thanks to her BGT run, Ikumu has gained an audience that listens and supports her music career.</p><p>Despite failing to pass the semi-final stage, Ikumu returned as a wildcard in the finals of the season. Since the singer had such a great experience on the show, she entered various local competitions after BGT.</p><p>The budding singer moved on to compete in local <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talent competitions</a> such as Midlands Teen Star and Milton Keynes Young Musician of the Year. The rising star has shined brighter and brighter on stage with her every performance singing astounding covers. Reportedly, Ikumu performed at a local event at the end of 2022.</p><p>In present day, Ikumu is very active on social media. She frequently posts covers of famous songs on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube channel</a>, where she currently has over 57 thousand subscribers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She is Working With Defective Records</h2><p>Ikumu’s undeniable talent has landed her a record deal with Defective Records, a British independent record label. Reportedly, Ikumu singing a rendition of Jennifer Hudson’s “And I’m Telling You I’m Not Going,” played a big role in landing her first record deal.</p><p>The DJ and label manager S.A.M. has thrived in carving out their distinctive sound and has found Ikumu to be the perfect addition to their team. She currently sings backing vocals for other artists signed to her record.</p><p>She has certainly come a long way from the young five-year-old who was inspired by her pastor father, Alex Gatoto. For those who don’t know, he was the driving force that encouraged Ikumu to share her voice with the world. Getting her to start singing in a church choir since childhood blossomed into a bright future in the world of music for Ikumu.</p><p>We can’t wait to see what Ikumu has planned in the upcoming year ahead. With over 49,000 followers on Instagram and over 57,000 subscribers on YouTube, it’s clear that the singer has the foundation to thrive in the music industry.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_TerryCrews_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Ranking Terry Crews’s Best ‘America’s Got Talent’ Outfits" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWZqHqjs9NmnqiklJq7bq7Us7Geql2nsqS1z6Kcp6xdqK6zrcdmoKStnap6tryMraZmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
