The Cannes Film Festival has been buzzing, with celebrities showing off their most glamorous outfits. Kevin Costner really stood out, rocking a gray mustache along with his usual soul patch and looking totally different. His new look is probably for his lead role in Horizon: An American Saga, which he's also directing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kevin Costner really stood out, rocking a gray mustache along with his usual soul patch and looking totally different. His new look is probably for his lead role in <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Horizon: An American Saga</i></a>,<i> </i>which he's also directing.</p><p>Stepping onto the red carpet, the actor brought along a surprise guest—his son Hayes. Dressed in matching white suits, Kevin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opted</a> for a button-up shirt, while Hayes kept it relaxed in a gray t-shirt. Yet, it wasn't just the father-son duo that turned heads; internet sleuths couldn't help but notice the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Yellowstone</i></a> star's striking transformation. Gone was the clean-shaven look, replaced by a bold mustache, and his hair now flaunted a vibrant reddish blonde hue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/424/eb7/790f59536eafe65fcd0c5bbeaf.jpg><p>CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p>Fans were thrilled to see Hayes with his dad, noting how much he takes after Kevin. But Kevin's new hair color didn't escape comment, with one fan suggesting it was time to let go of the dye, <i>"Nice looking</i>,<i> son. Time to stop dyeing the hair," </i>one fan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>. Others wondered about the sudden change, and some even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joked</a> that maybe their hairdresser wasn't doing them any favors.</p><p>On <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, some people didn't even realize it was Kevin and wondered what happened to his hair. Others just wished he'd go back to his usual look.</p><p>Some folks didn't like Kevin's new look. One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, "His hair looks ridiculous," and another commented, "Kevin looks goofy," while someone else added, "The dyed hair is hideous." Another person just said, "Really bad look, Kev."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e5/b23/e740cd5f09851db6020bdb6e36.jpg><p>CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p>Comments flooded, like those <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asking</a>, "<i>That's Costner?</i> " and another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adding</a>, <i>"What happened to Costner's hair?"</i></p><p>Later on, during the event, Kevin proudly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>introduced</a> his other children. The whole <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> looked fantastic, showing their support for the actor and his son. Kevin was surrounded by his children Annie, Cayden, Grace, Hayes, and Lily. This red carpet moment was especially meaningful because Kevin Costner was promoting a film in which he starred alongside his son.</p><p>While Hayes doesn't often appear in public with his father, the 15-year-old has decided to pursue acting, following in his father’s footsteps, and made his debut in<i> Horizon: An American Saga</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/087/0d8/964f2057f1bff299e18760a04d.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>Being seen together at&nbsp;the Cannes Festival with his family demonstrated just how successfully Kevin has brought his <a href=#>family</a> together post-divorce.</p><p>Preview photo credit CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News<span>, </span>CYRIL PECQUENARD/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmecuopqSrXZy8sLLYZqeep6Chsm6%2BxJqarWWkpHqssdWipWabn6jBr7HRrGSnnadisbqxw2afmqGiYoVyhY9yb2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
