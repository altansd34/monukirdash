Sometimes we just have to blurt it out: “I love you!”, but other times you might be able to do a bit of preparation. If you are looking for different ways to say “I love you”, here are some phrases you can use to make that person feel really special.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Classic ways to say&nbsp;“I love you”</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I love you</h3><p>Sweet, simple and easy to remember. The classic, “I love you”, “I love you too” is sometimes all we need to say and hear. Remember that we can also say “I love you” to family members and friends too – it’s not just for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lovers in our lives</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I’m in love with you</h3><p>This phrase is a bit more intense than the simple, “I love you”. “I’m in love with you” can only be said in a romantic way – so don’t mistakenly say this to your great aunt Mildred.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You’re the love of my life</h3><p>This is a serious declaration, so only say this if you’re really sure that it’s true. Telling someone, “You’re the love of my life” implies that you want to be with them forever and there’ll never be anyone else.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Different ways to say&nbsp;“I love you”&nbsp;in English</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I love you to the moon and back</h3><p>What’s more romantic than gazing at the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moon</a></strong>? Maybe telling your partner, “I love you to the moon and back.” The phrase is quite famous for being in the children’s book&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guess how much I love you?</a>” but it’s used for romantic as well as non-romantic love now.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>I’m crazy about you</strong></h3><p>This is quite a modern and different way to say “I love you”. And it doesn’t always mean “I love you”, it could just be that you really, really like someone. So if you’re using this phrase, it’s a good idea to clarify with ‘I’m crazy about you, I love you so much,’ or something similar.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>I’m head over heels for you</strong></h3><p>“I’m head over heels for you” means I’m totally and utterly in love with you and I can’t think about anything or anyone else.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You’re my other half.</h3><p>This is a sweet way to tell someone you love them so much that they complete you. (Side note: “You complete me” is also a way to tell someone you love them.) Brits often use the phrase “my other half” when they’re referring to their husband or wife, e.g. “My other half’s at the bar, getting the beers in.”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Songs to say&nbsp;“I love you”&nbsp;in English</h2><p>There are also other ways to say “I love you”: Using a&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song</a></strong>&nbsp;or saying a line from a song can be a very romantic way. Here are some lines that you could use to declare your love. Bonus points if you sing the song yourself.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I will always love you</h3><p>Is there a more overblown romantic song than this one? Whether you go for the original Dolly Parton or Whitney Houston’s Bodyguard version, your someone special will definitely feel your love.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>I can’t help falling in love with you</h3><p>Conjure up a little Las Vegas-style love with Elvis Presley’s&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Can’t help falling in love with you</a>“. The song is about falling in love with someone quickly, so this is a good line to use when you haven’t known someone long but you know you love them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You are my sunshine</h3><p>A very sweet way to say “I love you” is by telling that special someone, “You are my sunshine”. It’s been covered by a lot of different artists so you can pick your poison, so to speak. This song is also often sung by parents to their children as a&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nursery rhyme.</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>You’re amazing just the way you are</h3><p>Bruno Mars’&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Just the way you are</a>”&nbsp;is the perfect song to tell someone you love them for exactly who they are. It was written for a girl but that doesn’t stop you from telling your gentleman friend that you wouldn’t change a thing about them.</p><p>Now you have at least 10 different ways to tell someone “I love you”. So there’s no excuse; get out there and start <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">declaring your love</a>!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
