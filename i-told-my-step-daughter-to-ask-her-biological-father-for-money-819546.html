I married my wife Elise 12 years ago. She has a 16-year-old daughter (Ana) from her previous relationship and we have a 7-year-old son as well.
From pretty much the beginning of our relationship, Ana and I have never gotten along."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She has a&nbsp;16-year-old daughter (Ana) from her previous <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a></strong> and we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;7-year-old son as&nbsp;well.</p><p>From pretty much the beginning of&nbsp;our relationship, <strong>Ana and&nbsp;I have never gotten along.</strong> I&nbsp;don’t know how to&nbsp;emphasize that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;NOT because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;trying. <strong>She just does not like&nbsp;me</strong>. When she was young she was just scared of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and “afraid I’d tear their family apart”. Nowadays it’s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;neutral dislike rather than strong antipathy so&nbsp;I suppose that’s progress.</p><p>Elise is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stay-at-home mother, so&nbsp;she relies on&nbsp;me&nbsp;for income. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, <strong>I&nbsp;pay for everything for Ana</strong>. Food. Clothes. Volleyball fees. Field trips. I&nbsp;take an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;her hobbies. I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;her games. I’m not saying I’m perfect but&nbsp;<strong>I try my&nbsp;hardest to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the step-father I&nbsp;can.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c03/bbc/f2b82b5901a6871386927dc7a1.jpg><p>But it’s so... hard. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Always</a> giving me&nbsp;curt 1-word responses. Always have to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;attitude. She does things to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;rise out of&nbsp;me. Typical rebellious stuff. But I&nbsp;always let her know&nbsp;I love her and I’m there for her in&nbsp;hopes of&nbsp;her “teenager” phase past.</p><p><strong>The opposite is&nbsp;true for her biological father. She adores him.</strong> Can’t tell you why. He&nbsp;never goes to&nbsp;her games, and always makes excuses for why he&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;see her. He&nbsp;forgot her birthday last month and she cried herself to&nbsp;sleep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/830/d2e/e261c55d5ab42aa621e86c5f55.jpg><p>Well anyway, on&nbsp;Friday, I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>came</a> to&nbsp;her room to&nbsp;check her phone and read her messages (not a&nbsp;permanent thing, but she’s been caught sneaking out twice in&nbsp;the last month so&nbsp;this is&nbsp;her punishment). I&nbsp;ask for the phone, she says “No, I’m tired of&nbsp;you checking my&nbsp;stuff, leave me&nbsp;alone”.</p><p>I&nbsp;tell her I’m not asking again and <strong>she goes “You’re not my&nbsp;real dad. You never have been. Stop acting like you can tell me&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do”</strong> before getting up&nbsp;and slamming the door. Like I&nbsp;said, guys. I’m tired. Tired of&nbsp;the blatant disrespect. Of&nbsp;being the verbal punching bag while still providing more for her than anyone else in&nbsp;her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba4/03a/40d211521a83550cb5a39d9de6.jpg><p>We&nbsp;haven’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> since until this morning during breakfast. She asked if&nbsp;I could pay for her plane tickets so&nbsp;she could see her boyfriend cross-state. Like I&nbsp;said, her mom doesn’t work so&nbsp;I normally would be&nbsp;the one to&nbsp;cough up&nbsp;the money. Not this time. <strong>I&nbsp;responded, “Go&nbsp;ask your real dad”</strong>. I&nbsp;could tell she was hurt. <strong>Tears swelled up&nbsp;from her face and she excused herself from the table.</strong></p><p>My&nbsp;wife took me&nbsp;aside later and said my&nbsp;comment was extremely disrespectful. I&nbsp;said if&nbsp;anything’s disrespectful, it’s her treating me&nbsp;like a&nbsp;doormat and a&nbsp;credit card, and&nbsp;I will no&nbsp;longer tolerate this treatment in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house. I&nbsp;told her we&nbsp;don’t have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friends, but if&nbsp;she can’t at&nbsp;least be&nbsp;cordial to&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> my&nbsp;position as&nbsp;an&nbsp;authority figure, she can find someone else to&nbsp;pay for her non-essentials.</p><p><h2>People thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddc/cd4/d755075e29becf934d8c60354a.jpg><ul readability=12.588028169014><li>I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;slightly different perspective.

I&nbsp;trusted my&nbsp;mom enough to&nbsp;dare to&nbsp;be&nbsp;angry. I&nbsp;knew she would not abandon&nbsp;me. But I&nbsp;agree that the stepdaughter needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respectful.

Maybe ask her why she doesn’t like you. Ask if&nbsp;there’s anything you can do&nbsp;to&nbsp;support her better.

It’s an&nbsp;awful thing and&nbsp;I wouldn’t wish it&nbsp;on&nbsp;anyone.<p>The incident you described...dude you’re reading through a&nbsp;16-year-old’s phone. What do&nbsp;you expect? You’re not giving her any privacy, I’d be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;a&nbsp;16-year-old didn’t lash out like that.

She IS&nbsp;treating you like her real dad. The behavior, the disrespect, the insistence that you get out of&nbsp;her life but leave your wallet behind. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;normal behavior for teenagers and their fathers.<p>Her so-called real dad, she knows he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;poor bet. That’s why he&nbsp;gets the best of&nbsp;her. She HAS to&nbsp;give him her best because he&nbsp;won’t stick around otherwise. You get everything bad because actually, she trusts you. She sees you as&nbsp;The Father who can handle everything, her bio dad is&nbsp;just Uncle Daddy.</p><p>You can fix this, you explain to&nbsp;her that you love her, that she is&nbsp;your daughter, but you’re tired of&nbsp;feeling like an&nbsp;ATM. Lay some guilt&nbsp;on.
