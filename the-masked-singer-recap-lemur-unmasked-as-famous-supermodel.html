Meanwhile, Miss Teddy and Ringmaster emerged as contenders for the Golden Mask trophy.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lemur-unmasked-as-christie-brinkley-on-the-masked-singer>Lemur Unmasked as Christie Brinkley on ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>The Masked Singer‘s Lemur showed off a long, furry tail and some serious sparkles. For Wednesday’s performance, she sang “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King. She didn’t have the strongest voice, but she gave it her all and seemed to be having a good time.</p><p>At the end of the night, Lemur received the least amount of votes to move on to the next round, so she was eliminated. Final guesses from the judges included Goldie Hawn, Melanie Griffith, and Pamela Anderson. But only Jeong was correct with his guess of Brinkley.</p><p>Throughout the episode, the audience expressed their disagreement with Jeong’s choices. He guessed that Ringmaster was Kelly Clarkson and had earlier thought Lemur might be Jennifer Aniston. But he saved his reputation with his final guess. Even before the unmasking, Robin Thicke said it was his “best guess in seven seasons.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-many-people-are-in-the-hydra-costume>How Many People Are in the Hydra Costume?</h2><p>One of the most memorable performances of the night came from Team Bad’s Hydra, who has the first three-headed costume of the series. The judges weren’t sure exactly how many people were inside, but they seemed to agree that it was definitely more than two.</p><p>The celebrities under the mask called themselves “bad boys” and “amigos.” They performed “Hey Soul Sister” by Train, showing off very different voices with plenty of personality. Guesses from the judges included the Three Amigos themselves — Martin Short, Chevy Chase, and Steve Martin.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>WHICH OF ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CELEBRITIES HAVE ACTED WITH KEN JEONG?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miss-teddy-ringmaster-emerge-as-frontrunners>Miss Teddy, Ringmaster Emerge as Frontrunners</h2><p>The strongest performances of the night undoubtedly came from Miss Teddy and Ringmaster. Team Cuddly member Miss Teddy sang “Tell It to My Heart” by Taylor Dayne and shared some sweet words and a hug with host Nick Cannon. Guesses from the judges about Miss Teddy’s identity included Jill Scott and Loretta Devine.</p><p>Later in the show, Team Good’s Ringmaster wowed the judges with a performance of “The Climb” by Miley Cyrus. The clue package also suggested that Ringmaster might have a connection to Cyrus. They showed off a strong country-tinged voice and suggested that they know judge Nicole Scherzinger personally. Guesses included Kacey Musgraves and Olivia Rodrigo.</p><p>Jenny McCarthy predicted that Ringmaster will make it to the finale. If they do, they’ll <a href=#>go up against Firefly</a>, who was the first contestant to make it to the final round. We can’t wait to hear more from the remaining contestants in next week’s episode.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cade-foehner-770x428.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Alum Cade Foehner After a Rockstar Season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6s7HCmqdmpJWiwrN51KekmqubmrFurdJmnZqln6rAbr%2FUqZyrpZ%2BZsq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
