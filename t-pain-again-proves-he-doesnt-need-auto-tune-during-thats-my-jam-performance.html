Seems easy enough. The challenge for contestants is singing the lyrics along to another song’s instrumental. T-Pain was tasked to sing Green’s “Forget You,” over Simple Minds’s “Don’t You (Forget About Me).”</p><p>“You couldn’t pick two more different songs,” the singer said.</p><p>Host Jimmy Fallon assured T-Pain that this would be a walk in the park. T-Pain’s partner, Anthony Anderson, also showed faith in the “Buy U a Drank” singer. He was more nervous for this than he is participating in the dangerous acts on Season 2 of <a href=#>Go-Big Show</a>.</p><p>After insisting that he will not do well, T-Pain slipped right into an electrifying performance. Fallon stood shocked that T-Pain could actually sing. Shocking fans with his voice is nothing new. Listeners are used to hearing an auto-tune in the singer’s hit songs. The last couple of years T-Pain has been working hard to prove that he is a real singer. In a recent interview he revealed that he became depressed after Usher told him that he ruined music by using so much auto-tune in his songs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/Y0V086PIg58</p></figure><p>Fans of the show will remember Cee Lo Green as one of the first coaches to join the competition show. Green swiveled his chair for three seasons on The Voice. He returned in Season 5, but left after and has not returned since.</p><p>T-Pain’s episode of That’s My Jam also featured two other The Voice alumni. Bebe Rexha was featured on the episode. Rexha served as an advisor to Team Blake during Season 18 of the show. Adam Levine’s Season 5 advisor Ryan Tedder was also on the night’s show. Fans will also remember the four current The Voice judges, Kelly Clarkson, Ariana Grande, Blake Shelton, and John Legend all appearing on That’s My Jam’s <a href=#>premiere episode</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/imdb.jpeg alt="‘Real Dirty Dancing’ to Feature ‘Dirty Dancing’ Star Jane Brucker as Guest Judge" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Go-Big Show</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>t-pain</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5702anmqGeYq6orcinZKmqn6uytHnHnmSdp5Wou7V5zZ6cnWWRqsGwedOupZ5llKq%2FqrrGZquhmaSoeq7FjKOYpmWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
