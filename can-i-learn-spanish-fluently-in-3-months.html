You want to speak Spanish fluently and you want to do it&nbsp;now.&nbsp;But fluency in 3 months is impossible, right? Actually, no. Iâ€™ve seen somebody go from zero to fluent Spanish in 3 months. It was all about the learning process.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learning Spanish in less than 3 months</h2><p>Back in 2004 I went to Madrid, Spain for a semester abroad study programme. I had two roommates that took classes at an English-speaking American university. Neither of them spoke Spanish.</p><p>As Iâ€™ve mentioned on this blog before, I spent the semester scrambling to learn&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">useful Spanish words</a></strong>&nbsp;and gain fluency in my full-Spanish programme. Despite my own efforts, the most remarkable improvement I saw in learning Spanish wasnâ€™t mine but that of my roommate Flora.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Spanish language learning process</h3><p>Flora had never taken a Spanish class before. Yet somehow between late September and holiday break in December, Flora became fluent. I was shocked. Beyond typical&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish phrases for beginners</a></strong>, she was actually having full-on Spanish conversations.&nbsp;</p><p>We all know the immersive experience is a case of â€˜baptism by fireâ€™ but letâ€™s break it down. What did Floraâ€™s study abroad experience give herâ€”and can it be duplicated by learning Spanish online?</p><p>I believe Floraâ€™s success can be copied from home. Her learning process can be broken down into three successful areas: She managed her time, used every resource, and spoke Spanish on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Manage your Spanish learning time</h3><p>First, Flora managed her learning time. She attended classes in English but she took Spanish class seriously. She read her textbooks every afternoon. She practiced reading signs. On the way to student clubs in Plaza de Chueca, she would whip out her pocket notebook and write down phrases we heard. She worked Spanish language learning into her schedule anytime she could.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Spanish language learning resources</h3><p>Flora also plugged into every available resource. She watched the JosÃ© AndrÃ©s cooking show every day during&nbsp;siesta&nbsp;lunchtime. She listened to popular Spanish music on the radio. She noted down Spanish song lyrics from the&nbsp;discotecas&nbsp;at night. She went out of her way to memorize everything Spanish phrase she could find.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Daily Spanish conversation</h3><p>Finally, Flora spoke Spanish every day. She would invite me to a jug of sangria to drill her on Spanish grammar. She made a friend at school (ok, a boyfriend ðŸ˜‰ ) that she spent all her time with. Floraâ€™s rapid learning technique of time management, resources, and daily conversation practice is actually something that language learners can duplicate from anywhere.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Learn Spanish online with Lingoda</h3><p>For managing time, online learning is great.&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda</a>&nbsp;</strong>has classes that fit any schedule. Do you want to chat at 3 a.m.? Perfect. You can study around school, work, and family responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>You can get Spanish listening resources online: On <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>&nbsp;</strong>or on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lingoda podcast.</a></p><p>As for practice, Lingoda has native Spanish-speaking teachers. They teach you things a textbook canâ€™t. For example, did you know Spanish words in Spain are&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not the same in Mexico</a>?</strong>&nbsp;Live instructors on video chat give you real-time feedback and tips. There are even&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">group classes</a></strong>&nbsp;for a social element.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lingoda Language Sprint Challenge</h3><p>Flora had another thing that got her fluent in Spanish in 3 months: motivation. She devoted herself to an intensive study regimen. This urgent motivation is crucial to why immersion brings success in language learning. To provide this, language learning schools are innovating. Whether you are motivated by a challenge or cash money, Lingoda has a cool opportunity with their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Language Sprint</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With her serious motivation, my study abroad roommate Flora became fluent in Spanish in 3 months. I honestly believe that by following the same technique, you can do the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
