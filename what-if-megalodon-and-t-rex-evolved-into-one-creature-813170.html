No&nbsp;human has ever set foot here.</p><p>You’ve discovered a&nbsp;huge footprint of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown creature on&nbsp;the sandy beach. The size of&nbsp;the print is&nbsp;more than half of&nbsp;your <a href=# title=vehicle data-link=tag>vehicle</a>. Suddenly, out of&nbsp;the tropical forest that borders with the beach, you hear a&nbsp;deafening roar. Palm trees crack and break as&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown monster comes out of&nbsp;the jungle. To&nbsp;understand what it&nbsp;is, let’s go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c11/a16/6cdd535434a028174a0cc092e5.png><p>Hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;years ago, shortly before the huge meteorite hit the Earth, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;tyrannosaurs migrated to&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;the North Atlantic. There, they got to&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge bay facing the ocean. For a&nbsp;long time, thanks to&nbsp;the natural protection of&nbsp;this place, they were safe from all natural disasters that had been occurring to&nbsp;the Earth at&nbsp;that time.</p><p>The fall of&nbsp;a&nbsp;meteorite, the ice age, and <a href=# title=earthquakes data-link=tag>earthquakes</a> didn’t bother the T-rexes much. But they weren’t the only monsters in&nbsp;this place. A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;megalodons swam to&nbsp;the bay for safety too. The most ferocious creatures of&nbsp;the oceans and of&nbsp;land were forced to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;one place.</p><p>For millions of&nbsp;years, these monsters cooked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge cauldron called <a href=# title=evolution data-link=tag>evolution</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, a&nbsp;new creature of&nbsp;destructive power appeared. The new hybrid beast has the very best of&nbsp;two ancient titans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/01d/370/5b20a05227a24e88612410fa07.png><p>Tyrannosaurus rex: with a&nbsp;length of&nbsp;40&nbsp;feet and weighing about 9&nbsp;tons, it’s roughly the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;school bus. The king of&nbsp;dinosaurs had thick and strong neck muscles that could hold a&nbsp;large skull and jaws filled with 60&nbsp;sharp teeth. And the thick tail of&nbsp;the T-rex helped to&nbsp;balance the body.</p><p>The bite force of&nbsp;the giant dino reached 12,800&nbsp;pounds, which is&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult elephant sat on&nbsp;you. Strong enough, but it’s nothing compared to&nbsp;the strength and size of&nbsp;the Megalodon.</p><p>This shark reached 50&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;length, slightly less than a&nbsp;subway car, and weighed 75&nbsp;tons which is&nbsp;more than a&nbsp;tank. This is&nbsp;almost 8&nbsp;times heavier than a&nbsp;T-rex. The megalodon’s jaws were filled with 300 sharp teeth, each the size of&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult human palm. And the bite force of&nbsp;a&nbsp;megalodon is&nbsp;6&nbsp;times stronger than the T-rex’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/be3/8a2/ddacc05f85ab83d9d69116393d.png><p>And here, these two beasts become one, inheriting strong megalodon jaws, 360&nbsp;teeth, and a&nbsp;massive tyrannosaurus skull. The hybrid monster moves on&nbsp;two legs, but has fins on&nbsp;its back and the tip of&nbsp;the tail, and webbed toes. Its length from the tail to&nbsp;the skull is&nbsp;70&nbsp;feet, and its weight is&nbsp;about 90&nbsp;tons! This is&nbsp;the largest creature in&nbsp;the entire history of&nbsp;the planet. After a&nbsp;blue whale, of&nbsp;course. Since it&nbsp;survived all natural disasters and had no&nbsp;competitors in&nbsp;the food chain, it’s been able to&nbsp;live to&nbsp;this day.</p><p>And here you see the megalodon rex. Or&nbsp;tyranolodon, however you want. Its roar deafens you. The monster is&nbsp;coming at&nbsp;you. Every step feels like a&nbsp;little earthquake. You press the gas pedal, but the car doesn’t go&nbsp;— the wheels are stuck in&nbsp;the sand. There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;choice&nbsp;— you leave the car and take an&nbsp;inflatable boat with a&nbsp;small motor from the trunk.</p><p>At&nbsp;this moment, the tyranolodon grabs the jeep with its jaws and crushes it&nbsp;like a&nbsp;cardboard box. The pressure comparable to&nbsp;the weight of&nbsp;6&nbsp;adult elephants is&nbsp;now being applied to&nbsp;your jeep. The monster chews it&nbsp;like chewing gum. You can hear its sharp teeth cutting through the <a href=# title=metal data-link=tag>metal</a> and rubber on&nbsp;the wheels. Then, the dinosaur spits the car out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c52/6fb/d59dff567db8d4523c661176e5.png><p>Meanwhile, you run to&nbsp;the water, start the engine and sail away on&nbsp;the boat as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible. The dinosaur runs after you and jumps into the ocean. It&nbsp;swims like a&nbsp;shark. You can see a&nbsp;fin sticking out of&nbsp;the water, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small sailing boat. Fortunately, the monster isn’t able to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;with you.</p><p>The megalodon’s speed is&nbsp;about 10&nbsp;mph. But now, it&nbsp;slows down almost twice, because it&nbsp;has massive hind legs. The webbing on&nbsp;the legs helps to&nbsp;swim, but it’s still a&nbsp;big weight. The physical form of&nbsp;the dinosaur doesn’t allow it&nbsp;to&nbsp;accelerate too much.&nbsp;8&nbsp;mph is&nbsp;its maximum.</p><p>The fin is&nbsp;moving further and further away from you. But at&nbsp;this moment, the engine starts to&nbsp;rattle. You remember that you didn’t fill the tank with fuel. This means that in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes, you will be&nbsp;left alone with a&nbsp;huge predator.</p><p>It&nbsp;won’t see you since you’ve sailed far away. But the shark part of&nbsp;our monster has a&nbsp;great sense of&nbsp;smell in&nbsp;the water. You won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;escape its nose. You turn the boat and head for the shore. In&nbsp;the distance, the triangular fin is&nbsp;swimming around. You give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide berth to&nbsp;avoid getting caught by&nbsp;tyranolodon. But you don’t have enough gas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a59/cd9/ef2b155083b8881a13acc7cd8a.png><p>The engine shuts off. You start rowing with an&nbsp;oar, but now you’re moving too slow. The monster is&nbsp;inevitably catching up&nbsp;with you. A&nbsp;huge dinosaur emerges from the water and falls back, creating a&nbsp;huge wave. It&nbsp;throws you to&nbsp;the shore along with the boat.</p><p>The monster comes out of&nbsp;the water and runs after you. You have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;save yourself because... the speed of&nbsp;the tyranolodon is&nbsp;about 10&nbsp;mph, which is&nbsp;slightly slower than the speed of&nbsp;the T-rex. You run and easily find shelter. But you realize in&nbsp;time this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad tactic since the T-rex part of&nbsp;the monster has well-developed smell receptors. It&nbsp;can sniff you out as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;domestic cat. You just need to&nbsp;run as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible from this beast.</p><p>You can hear the deafening roar of&nbsp;the Megalodon Rex behind you. Trees are breaking, the ground is&nbsp;shaking. But then, it’s suddenly all quiet. The tyranolodon’s heart does hard work when it&nbsp;pumps blood through the huge dinosaur’s body. When it&nbsp;runs, the heart works even more intensively. Because of&nbsp;this load, the dinosaur has little endurance. It&nbsp;quickly runs out of&nbsp;energy. Perhaps it’s sitting on&nbsp;the ground right now and catching its breath. Tired, you also stop.</p><p>You can’t hear the dinosaur’s footsteps. The T-rex couldn’t hunt small dinosaurs as&nbsp;they easily ran away from&nbsp;it. And its approach was heard from afar. Only big plant-eating dinosaurs, as&nbsp;slow as&nbsp;itself, could become its dinner. It’s the 21st century now, and the dinosaurs are extinct. Then what does this monster eat?</p><p>At&nbsp;this moment, you can hear the trees crunching a&nbsp;few feet away from you. Through the bushes and leaves, you can see a&nbsp;large triangular plate. You run to&nbsp;the side and realize that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real stegosaurus! It&nbsp;seems the Jurassic period is&nbsp;still preserved on&nbsp;this piece of&nbsp;land. The herbivorous dinosaur, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus, calmly eats grass and... makes noise. On&nbsp;the other side, you hear the heavy footsteps of&nbsp;the hungry tyranolodon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4a6/36b/4be4b45d4b92123c5c295f42c4.png><p>The stegosaurus senses the upcoming enemy. It&nbsp;gets into a&nbsp;fighting position. Tyranolodon is&nbsp;approaching. You run back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe place and watch the fight. Tyranolodon runs out of&nbsp;the jungle. It&nbsp;growls, opens its massive jaw, and attacks the herbivore. The stegosaurus quickly hits the enemy with its barbed tail. The Tyranolodon falls to&nbsp;the side. Trees shatter into splinters, and the ground shakes under the huge monster.</p><p>It&nbsp;gets up&nbsp;and furiously runs at&nbsp;the opponent. You decide to&nbsp;run away to&nbsp;buy yourself some time.</p><p>You come to&nbsp;the shore, jump on&nbsp;the boat, and row as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible from this bay. The roars of&nbsp;two giant dinosaurs come from the jungle. You decide to&nbsp;sail along the bay and get to&nbsp;the beach with civilization. While you’re sailing, you notice that it&nbsp;has suddenly become quiet. Too quiet. Waves appear on&nbsp;the surface, but there’s no&nbsp;wind. The water bubbles and you hear a&nbsp;terrible hum from the ocean depths.</p><p>Through the blue surface, you can see several tentacles. They’re huge, and they’re on&nbsp;your every side. This must be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge squid or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;Kraken! But then you see the head of&nbsp;this monster is&nbsp;a&nbsp;shark’s one. Now you definitely can’t escape, because the Krakelodon swims out of&nbsp;the water! But this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely different story.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lnZq0orjOnaanZZGjsW7AjKucsWWVq7ytwsSdZKKmpKR6sLrEZpqrnZGpwrOxjHFobGlnZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
