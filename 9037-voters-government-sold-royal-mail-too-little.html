In anticipation of the deal, 43% believed the Royal Mail was being sold for less than it was worth; now two thirds (66%) of the public do.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Royal20Mail202.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The belief that the Royal Mail was sold too cheaply is now shared by the majority of supporters of every major party, including 60% of Conservatives (up from just 34% in October) and 69% of Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Shares in the Royal Mail have increased 70% since their flotation, something voters may have taken note of even before this week’s National Audit Office report.
