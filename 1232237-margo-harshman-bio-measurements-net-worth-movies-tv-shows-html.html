What is the point? In fact, Margo started acting years ago as a child. Then, she grew up in the process of acting and gradually turned into the celebrity we know now. She is not a big star, but she is too young to stop developing her skills. The prime of her fame is still ahead, and we are looking forward to seeing her in new feature films!</p><h2>Margo Harshman movies and TV shows: naming the most popular</h2><p class=align-left>The actress has played many roles since the first child appearances on the screen. The most recent role that has given her quite a bit of popularity is Delilah Fielding, a character from “NCIS”. One of the most catching peculiarities of this character is her extremely smart brain. What is more, Delilah, the wife of a special agent, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has paraplegia</a>. Playing such roles is always a challenge for an actor because physically or mentally handicapped characters always give a good deal of drama to the atmosphere around them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f58ddea817fed3c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>America no easy o: Actress Regina Askia finally buys house in the US after many years of working there</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tawny Dean from “Even Stevens” was the first significant role for Ms Harshman. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She was only 14</a> at the moment when she started to perform this character and used to do it for three whole years. This development from a child into a teenage girl and from a child into an almost grown-up actress has also reflected in the development of her talent. It was the moment when producers could see her as a promising actress with big potential. So this role turned into a real platform for Margo’s big start towards her acting career.</p><p class=align-left>Alex Jensen from “The Big Bang Theory” was recognisable and bright. Acting as the assistant of Sheldon Cooper, one of the main characters, Ms Harshman has managed to bring her own tune into the scenario of the show. Even though her part on the show lasted for only <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three years</a> (between 2010 and 2013), Alex has become one of the essential elements of the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d60d7481c5d7afd6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about NCIS' Necar Zadegan</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Robert Redford wife Sibylle Szaggars bio: top 10 facts about the artist</p><p class=align-left>Feature films in which Margo participated include “Sorority Row”, a horror movie for teenagers (and won a “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Female Star of Tomorrow</a>” award for this role of hers in 2009); a teenage drama “Keith” that has become the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best movie</a> at Giffoni Film Festival in Italy (2007); and a range of others.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">list of screen appearances </a>Ms Harshman has so far is quite impressive for a young actress, but her most significant fame is, probably, still ahead, waiting for her to come and take it. This should be a prominent feature film in which she will be able to play the main part and show the full power of her talent.</p><h2>How big is Margo Harshman net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Another question that bothers the minds of fans after the most impressive screen appearances is the net worth of their favourite celebrities. For instance, the actress's fans are interested in the amount she has managed to earn for all her roles on TV and in feature films.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7227ac5755553037.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The hcarming Lilan Bowden: her thorny path to success</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So, the actress’s net worth is estimated to be from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$3 million</a> to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$6 million</a> in different sources. Whichever amount is correct, it is a huge sum for a young woman whose career is only reaching its prime. In any case, we do expect that in the nearest future she will receive more roles and they, respectively, will juice her wallet significantly.</p><h2>What about Margo Harshman measurements?</h2><p class=align-left>We definitely know that this beautiful woman is slender and has an athletic built. As estimated, she is about 5 feet 4 inches tall (which stands for 162.5 cm) and weighs about 54 kilos. There is no precise information about her body measurements, but, as reported, her chest and hips are of a more or less the same size, about 35 inches (which stands for 89 cm). Her waist measurement is said to reach about 25 inches (63.5 cm).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c0332ace2e2f621.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover exciting and surprising facts about Kellita Smith!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This delicate and attractive frame is a result of active <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sports and dancing</a> the future actress was doing while at school.
