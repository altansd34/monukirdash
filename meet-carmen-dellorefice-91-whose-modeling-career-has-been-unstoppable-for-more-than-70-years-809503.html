Dell’Orefice and her mother earned extra money by&nbsp;sewing clothes and selling them. The young model’s family didn’t own a&nbsp;telephone either, so&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i> had to&nbsp;send people to&nbsp;inform her about upcoming gigs.</p><p></p><p><h2>She quickly became successful but had to&nbsp;face some problems.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15a/805/1aa0a35fbea6566b42830374cd.jpg><p>DALLAL/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>In&nbsp;her twenties, after years spent modeling for <i>Vogue</i>, Carmen Dell’Orefice caught the eye of&nbsp;<i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>’s fashion editor.

But Bill, her first husband, exploited her financially by&nbsp;picking up&nbsp;her checks and only giving her a&nbsp;small allowance. After this marriage ended in&nbsp;divorce, Dell’Orefice married photographer Richard Heimann, but their union also ended shortly after.</p><p><h2>After her third marriage ended, the model decided to&nbsp;resume working full-time at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;47.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/353/936/bc370458508f6ca6215917ecbc.png><p>“When I&nbsp;was 40, I&nbsp;was 40.

That is&nbsp;precisely why it&nbsp;has always felt wonderful to&nbsp;stand in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>camera</a>,” explained Dell’Orefice.</p><p>As&nbsp;the years went&nbsp;by, the model never felt like she no&nbsp;longer belonged to&nbsp;the fashion industry.

Now, at&nbsp;91, the model shows no&nbsp;signs of&nbsp;slowing down. In&nbsp;October 2022, she appeared alongside another supermodel, Beverly Johnson, on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cover</a> of&nbsp;<i>New You</i>.</p><p>“We&nbsp;keep <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>growing</a> every day, and we’re not finished until the day we’re finished. You learn something from the day before, and you’re constantly changing yourself like the hands of&nbsp;a&nbsp;clock,” said Dell’Orefice on&nbsp;how she incorporates aging into her life philosophy. She proves that models above a&nbsp;certain age can have very fruitful careers and that forced early retirement is&nbsp;something the fashion industry needs to&nbsp;leave behind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/715/a58/527d145116ba8639451385c6c1.jpg><p>Jack Shea/Starshots/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>What impressed you the most about Carmen Dell’Orefice’s story?
