The photos are from 1980 and 1996.</p><p>Before she became a&nbsp;<a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a> of&nbsp;the royal family, she led the modest lifestyle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>young <a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> <a href=#>aristocratic</a> girl </strong>and preferred to&nbsp;wear single-color shirts, classical sweaters, and comfortable cotton skirts, below the knee.</p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;her relationship with Charles and their <a href=#>engagement</a> in&nbsp;1981 made her review her wardrobe.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad8/ae2/48477d5be4b88993a4cfda1acc.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first, the future princess still could afford to&nbsp;wear casual-style suits. Soft-brimmed hats, unusual blouses, and oversized jackets&nbsp;— everything that was trendy in&nbsp;the ’80s. But her engagement with a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the royal family obliged Diana to&nbsp;pick her clothes more carefully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/752/378/c647b65dbd917576e99f7b666b.jpg><p><a href=#>Initially</a>, Diana was very modest and naive. Not having any idea about how a&nbsp;future princess should look, she started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through all the possible options&nbsp;— from “old lady’s” dresses with flower prints to&nbsp;weird blouses with ruffles. But Lady Di’s outstanding energy had already amazed the British and they would forgive the young miss Spencer for all her failures.</p><p class=adme-img-description>For instance, this <a href=#>outfit</a> Diana opted for a&nbsp;public event in&nbsp;1981.</p><h2>The day when an&nbsp;ordinary woman started to&nbsp;be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the royal family</h2><p>One month after their engagement, Diana and Charles went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity event at&nbsp;Goldsmiths’ Hall. Diana was wearing a&nbsp;strapless black evening dress with a&nbsp;neckline and a&nbsp;ruffle trim. That evening the media announced that from then on&nbsp;Diana could be&nbsp;considered the most stylish royal person in&nbsp;Great Britain.</p><p>Designers <a href=#>said</a> it&nbsp;was love at&nbsp;first sight between Diana and the dress: “She fell in&nbsp;love with&nbsp;it, and didn’t care that someone else had already worn it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity event... We&nbsp;didn’t even consider whether the dress was right for the occasion, we&nbsp;just thought she looked fabulous.”</p><p><h2>Princess Diana’s wedding dress caused a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;discussion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/715/3c0/5fb6fb557f8abb43dbcde6e647.jpg><p>Some people believed that this is&nbsp;what a&nbsp;truly royal wedding dress should look like. Other people were saying that Diana’s wedding dress is&nbsp;far from being perfect. The choice of&nbsp;fabric was a&nbsp;mistake&nbsp;— designers didn’t consider the fact that Diana <a href=#>would go</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ceremony with her father in&nbsp;a&nbsp;carriage that was very small for her dress. Eventually, Diana Spencer <a href=#>ended up&nbsp;standing</a><strong> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very creased dress</strong> at&nbsp;the altar. The gown <a href=#>was made</a> of&nbsp;silk taffeta and antique lace, it&nbsp;was decorated with hand-made embroidery, 10&nbsp;thousand pearls, some of&nbsp;which were laid out in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;heart on&nbsp;the bodice area. The look was completed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;25-foot train, which erased Diana’s former modesty in&nbsp;one fell swoop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/782/166/eec8215d7abe9874d61ee3bafe.jpg><h2>During her first pregnancy, Diana <a href=#>preferred</a> to&nbsp;wear chic and loose outfits.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3eb/9f6/9240a25c8e9cb3f0f14d97a44c.jpg><p>They were usually decorated with ruffles, laces, and other feminine details. On&nbsp;the day she was leaving the hospital with the first prince, the princess was wearing a&nbsp;loose green and white polka-dot <a href=#>dress</a> with a&nbsp;turn-down collar. It&nbsp;masterfully concealed <strong>Diana’s still-round belly.</strong></p><p><h2>After her son’s birth, Diana’s garments became more feminine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60c/9af/dafd69599b8a3be44ea83bd056.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the ’80s, Diana started to&nbsp;correct her body shape with the help of&nbsp;clothing. Bows, satin ribbons on&nbsp;a&nbsp;slightly high waistline, and <a href=#>puffy sleeves</a>&nbsp;— all these emphasized the princess’ body shape. In&nbsp;everyday life, Lady Di&nbsp;preferred a&nbsp;free cuts, the simplicity of&nbsp;lines, and looking a&nbsp;little bit unkempt.</p><p><h2>The Princess wore the same outfit to&nbsp;several events, even though it&nbsp;contradicted royal etiquette.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d15/3af/16c02d5e32ac57157c5a5f3051.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;by&nbsp;the rule book... I&nbsp;lead from the heart, not the head,” she would <a href=#>say</a>. In&nbsp;support of&nbsp;her words, <strong>Diana wasn’t afraid to&nbsp;<a href=#>go&nbsp;out</a> in&nbsp;the same outfit more than once</strong>, which in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way fit into the framework of&nbsp;the royal family’s etiquette. The only rule that Diana wasn’t breaking was supporting local manufacturers.</p><p><h2>Diana wore black dresses, ignoring the rule that said this color is&nbsp;only for those in&nbsp;mourning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da7/730/0011ea55bd8b3650b344caf883.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1985, Lady Di&nbsp;danced with actor <a href=# title="John Travolta" data-link=tag>John Travolta</a> at&nbsp;an&nbsp;event. The photos of&nbsp;the dancing pair got spread all over the world. Later Travolta described this experience as&nbsp;being “like a&nbsp;fairy tale.” That black dress <strong>became historical</strong> and <a href=#>was sold</a> at&nbsp;an&nbsp;auction for a&nbsp;record 264,000 pound sterling (more than $350,000).</p><h2>She’s also had some <a href=#>mishaps</a> when choosing outfits.</h2><p>Diana could be&nbsp;confused for a&nbsp;waitress in&nbsp;this outfit.</p><p class=adme-img-description>This dress made even Lady Di’s ideal body shape disproportional.</p><p><h2>Diana opposed the royal system and emphasized this with her appearance.</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;might seem that a&nbsp;red manicure is&nbsp;universal. But it&nbsp;doesn’t suit women from the royal family&nbsp;— the protocol still <a href=#>lists</a> only natural shades of&nbsp;nail polish. The red polish on&nbsp;Diana’s nails <strong>demonstrated her courage</strong>. The princess started to&nbsp;opt for bright nail polish when her marriage with Charles started to&nbsp;break down. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;signal that she was opposing the system. Her trials to&nbsp;reconsider her outfits were conveying the same thing.</p><p class=adme-img-description>White dress with red polka dots and red coat, 1985</p><p class=adme-img-description>White skirt with red polka-dots worn with a&nbsp;sweatshirt, 1986</p><p><h2>Despite the troubles in&nbsp;the family, Diana was perfecting her style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab9/fdc/624c105b7b981ef53a6b3e5b89.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Diana casts a&nbsp;glance at&nbsp;her husband Prince Charles as&nbsp;he&nbsp;speaks at&nbsp;a&nbsp;press conference at&nbsp;the National Gallery of&nbsp;Art, in&nbsp;Washington, DC&nbsp;in&nbsp;1985.</p><p>“There were 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;us in&nbsp;this marriage, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit crowded,” <a href=#>said</a> Diana in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, speaking about her husband’s passion for Camilla Parker Bowles. Also being dissatisfied, Diana herself <strong><a href=#>started</a> an&nbsp;affair outside of&nbsp;her marriage</strong>. It&nbsp;didn’t stop her from mastering the art of&nbsp;style and she learned to&nbsp;skillfully choose accessories and jewelry. Sometimes the princess was ahead of&nbsp;the times in&nbsp;her looks, and soon afterward Diana became a&nbsp;trendsetter.</p><p><h2>Separation affected the Princess’ style</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/824/88d/b47bf651d7a3b95434414cd5f1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1992, Charles and Diana publicly declared the end of&nbsp;their relationship. The princess started to&nbsp;master the art of&nbsp;wearing high heels and started to&nbsp;give her preference to&nbsp;tight dresses that didn’t hide her gorgeous body shape. She started to&nbsp;flourish, she looked <strong>uninhibited and free</strong>. It&nbsp;was clear that she didn’t like the dress code of&nbsp;the royal court. At&nbsp;that moment, Lady Di&nbsp;started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for dresses with deep necklines for evening outings, and that’s when she came up&nbsp;with the famous <a href=#>trick</a> with miniature bags, which she used for covering her neckline when getting out of&nbsp;cars.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;breaking point in&nbsp;Diana’s life happened in&nbsp;1994 when Prince Charles publicly confessed he&nbsp;was having an&nbsp;affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c40/93c/f7a281517c8ad616a8093db786.jpg><p>The story that started out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fairytale has a&nbsp;sad ending. It&nbsp;finished with a&nbsp;public scandal. Lady Diana was betrayed by&nbsp;her spouse and she decided to&nbsp;get revenge on&nbsp;him, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful manner, for his cheating. That’s when she openly broke royal protocol for the first time, having put on<strong>&nbsp;the famous “<a href=#>revenge dress</a>.”</strong> The little black dress with the dropped shoulder line made a&nbsp;splash. No&nbsp;traces were left from the former “good girl”&nbsp;— she was replaced with a&nbsp;self-confident woman who was not feeling shy when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;her beauty.</p><p><h2>Princess Diana gave herself a&nbsp;bit more leeway each year.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/191/8ac/eb48dc5506853b94be3192c776.jpg><p>After Prince Charles and Princess Diana started to&nbsp;live separately, she was seen more often appearing in<strong>&nbsp;trendy bright mini dresses </strong>in&nbsp;public. Lady Di’s wardrobe was complemented with romantic outfits. The life period of&nbsp;the Princess after her divorce was connected with <a href=#>love</a> and romance, and this was directly reflected in&nbsp;her looks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b6/b3b/d736295353a49f2bdc6fe91069.jpg><p><h2>In&nbsp;the last year of&nbsp;her life, Diana was engaged in&nbsp;charity work and traveling.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21d/fa7/4f1f3d5b0f9a33a27292c27080.jpg><p>Lady Di&nbsp;started to&nbsp;look less and less like royalty after her <a href=#>divorce</a> in&nbsp;August 1996. But even in&nbsp;simple clothes, <strong>she managed to&nbsp;look gorgeous</strong>. Diana <a href=#>made</a> the whole world think about people who were sick with AIDS and other conditions, like poverty. “Someone’s got to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out there and love people and show&nbsp;it,” she <a href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her last interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/594/beb/5feff353fd8ac6d585ff52545b.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc3/1ae/d6a9f45e21845c045645088457.jpg><p><h2>“I’d like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;queen of&nbsp;people’s hearts, in&nbsp;people’s hearts, but&nbsp;I don’t see myself being Queen of&nbsp;this country.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eae/f9d/69ec6651cdb80bb8baa1ad4957.jpg><p>Diana <a href=#>said</a> this during one of&nbsp;the interviews. She definitely managed to&nbsp;conquer people’s hearts. With mishaps, seemingly strange deeds, and extreme openness Princess Diana remained a&nbsp;favorite of&nbsp;millions forever. People appreciated her for her compassion, thanks to&nbsp;which, she was able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;many good things.</p><p>What feelings do&nbsp;you have when you read about Diana’s life story?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xec6fZKmqmaOwpr%2FSZpuimZ6WwG671K2doqyjYsGprdNmqZ6ulZa5bsPHmqtmr5Goeqmtz6mcp6GenHqqutKim55lmJq%2Fbr%2FOrqNmmpWpwaa%2BjK2fmqZdrLyzsNJmb2lpZmiFcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
