Aztecs are one of&nbsp;the pioneers of&nbsp;organic beauty and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;legacy, they have left&nbsp;us a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;practices that we&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;use in&nbsp;the present.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> selected a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;the Aztec Empire practices that show&nbsp;us how organic beauty has evolved and that, in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;health, they’ve never sacrificed their well-being.</p><p><h2>1. Natural perfumes and deodorants</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78f/7d5/1563455876bc0ded632dcb1159.jpg><p>Daily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aromatic baths</a> were essential for this culture. They had different ways of&nbsp;making perfumes and deodorants that would give them that clean feeling 24/7. Using different plants to&nbsp;create herbal juice, sweet-smelling flowers, and powdered bone, they used to&nbsp;make <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mixtures</a> that they applied as&nbsp;deodorants under their armpits.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, they had their own version of&nbsp;perfumes made from copal gum, liquid amber oil, and balsam oil. They also added their personal touch with shredded flowers, <a href=# title=fruits data-link=tag>fruits</a>, grains, and pine needles.</p><p><h2>2. Ancestral skincare routine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/326/6a6/0101965039a1a9ccef0471eec2.jpg><p>A&nbsp;clean face was a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;purity. Pioneers in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;natural beauty, it&nbsp;was believed that less was more. Most of&nbsp;these beauty practices were done as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ritual for finding a&nbsp;husband. Aztec women used to&nbsp;wash their faces and keep makeup to&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum, applying a&nbsp;yellow cream made from pulverized <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>axin</a>, which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;insect from tropical rainforests which gave a&nbsp;dazzling appearance to&nbsp;the complexion. And on&nbsp;special occasions, women used to&nbsp;tint their lips with a&nbsp;natural rouge tint.</p><p>To&nbsp;maintain their “eternal youthful appearance” they used to&nbsp;apply face masks with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secret ingredient</a>&nbsp;— mixing different herbs they added pigeon poop. Yes, you read&nbsp;it. This special ingredient was believed to&nbsp;work miracles with the skin.</p><p><h2>3. Organic soaps and detergents</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4b/f14/bcad2e553285c011be8eadaadb.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you struggle to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;bath daily, now imagine having 2&nbsp;daily baths, plus, sometimes, getting up&nbsp;at&nbsp;night to&nbsp;bathe in&nbsp;cold water. Aztecs took cleanliness very seriously. Their version of&nbsp;soap was made either from the fruit of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>copalxocotl</a> tree or&nbsp;from the roots of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>amolli</a> plant. Both of&nbsp;them generate a&nbsp;lather which was used for body washing and laundry.</p><p>Beyond hygienic purposes, this Aztec culture believed in&nbsp;the connection between body and soul. When merchants had to&nbsp;travel for long periods of&nbsp;time, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;sacrifice, they avoided these types of&nbsp;natural washing methods. On&nbsp;the other hand, when the prisoners were about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sacrificed, they were given a&nbsp;bath before meeting with the other ancestral side.</p><p><h2>4. Temazcal: Steam bath</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe4/1c7/bf17925f08a899d709f78efeb6.jpg><p>We&nbsp;call this the ancient spa routine. Known as&nbsp;temazcal, the place where steam baths were taken, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;practice very popular among cultures in&nbsp;Mexico and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Central America</a>. Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was just for mere relaxation, steam baths were also taken for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purification</a>, to&nbsp;cure some types of&nbsp;illness, and also to&nbsp;help pregnant women when giving birth.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aztec</a> steam bath consisted of&nbsp;a&nbsp;windowless room with a&nbsp;stone oven where a&nbsp;fire was built. When it&nbsp;was hot enough, cold water was thrown on&nbsp;it&nbsp;and clouds of&nbsp;steam were formed. There was always another person who attended the bather giving him or&nbsp;her a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;massage with bushes to&nbsp;improve body circulation.</p><p><h2>5. Chewing gum, honey toothpaste, and rattlesnake venom for dental care</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/453/fde/e12b6850fa95d55d1f739c727d.jpg><p>Dental care was another topic of&nbsp;interest. To&nbsp;brush their teeth they employed different <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>methods</a> like washing them with a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;<a href=# title=salt data-link=tag>salt</a>, chili, and tree bark, and rubbing them with charcoal, white honey, and white ashes.</p><p>Also, this might sound familiar to&nbsp;you. Chewing gum was another alternative to&nbsp;keep the breath fresh and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sweet</a>, serving also as&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>social status</a>. And in&nbsp;extreme cases, when it&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;remove teeth their own version of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anesthesia</a> consisted of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mixture of&nbsp;vinegar and rattlesnake venom. Would you dare?</p><p><h2>6. Aztec hairstyles and natural dyed hair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4dc/3d5/f360505f2ea2074648dcac87ad.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;say that the Aztecs took their appearance seriously, we&nbsp;mean&nbsp;it. During his exploration in&nbsp;Tenochtitlán, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hernán Cortés</a> noticed that they had barber shop-like establishments where residents used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;get their hair done. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hairstyles</a> and haircuts were also other identifiers of&nbsp;social status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f7/eee/15cdbb59ee9c548e7ad1a38803.jpg><p>Normal men used to&nbsp;wear short haircuts, while the distinguished class wore them long and pulled back. Women had a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;hairstyle options but there were 2&nbsp;trends that caught our attention. They used to&nbsp;wear avocado oil as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hair conditioner and xiuquilitl, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural tint that comes from a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flower</a>, to&nbsp;dye their hair in&nbsp;an&nbsp;indigo color.</p><p>We&nbsp;want to&nbsp;know what other beauty secrets your culture has.
