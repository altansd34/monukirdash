Unbeatable is Indestructible Despite Setbacks</h2><p>Living in the overpopulated slums of Mumbai, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">V. Unbeatable</a> had to endure life without clean water and electricity. In an attempt to create an opportunity for themselves, the group, originally named Unbeatable, was formed in 2012.</p><p>Unfortunately, the group’s co-founder Vikas Gupta faced an early demise after suffering a fatal spinal injury in 2015 during a dance practice. Since then, the dance group changed its name to V. Unbeatable, short for Vikas Unbeatable.</p><p>The dance troupe first appeared on AGT 2019, comprising 28 dancers aged between 12 to 27. Their mind-blowing audition consisted of members being thrown into the air and performing a flawlessly synchronized routine. They later secured the highly sought-after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Buzzer</a> by NBA All-Star and AGT guest Judge Dwyane Wade. Subsequently, they advanced to the Quarter-Finals of the series, unfortunately getting beaten by Kodi Lee.</p><p>They stepped on the AGT stage again for season two of AGT: The Champions. There, V. Unbeatable secured another Golden Buzzer and eventually reached first place. However, while this victory could’ve meant a better life for them, their plans were suppressed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>During lockdown, the members had to suffer from the same poor circumstances. Some even had to sell vegetables on the side of the road to get by. Be that as it may, their impoverished conditions didn’t stop them from dreaming big.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-staged-a-well-deserved-comeback-will-compete-on-agt-fantasy-league>They Staged a Well-Deserved Comeback, Will Compete on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>Soon after the lockdown demands were loosened up, V. Unbeatable got back on track. Starting 2023, the group went from 28 to 45 members. They then had an admirable comeback with their first international performances at Dubai’s Global Village. According to their team manager Vibhav Gupta, they were “over the moon” when first invited to Dubai.</p><p>“To be able to perform at a stage like Global Village in front of thousands every day, I feel like this was the break we needed after the lull of Covid,” Gupta told The Khaleej Times.</p><p>As they slowly climb their way to the industry again, they gear up for their comeback to the AGT stage. The Mumbai-dance troupe announced that they are among the 40 acts joining AGT: Fantasy League on Instagram.</p><p>“Hey Guys, We are so excited and happy to announce our participation in the New AGT Show Next Year!” they wrote.</p><p>V. Unbeatable is now in Los Angeles, preparing for their hopefully long journey on the show. Since their announcement, the group has been sharing photos, showing how they’ve been enjoying the place so far.</p><p>If you want to witness V. Unbeatable’s journey on the spinoff, be sure to tune in on the show. America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League premieres Monday, Jan. 1 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream the next day on Peacock.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_AGTFantasyLeague_coverart_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpg alt="How is ‘AGT: Fantasy League’ Different from ‘America’s Got Talent: The Champions’ and ‘All Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWViYsGqucRmnqiklJq7bq7Us7Geql2Zrq%2BvxGarq6elpbJuwoyupZudkamuo7jEZq6ipJxiwamx2GapnpuZmsOmecCnpq2glad6qrqMmp6tZZaWu7Wt0rJkpZ2RnMKmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
