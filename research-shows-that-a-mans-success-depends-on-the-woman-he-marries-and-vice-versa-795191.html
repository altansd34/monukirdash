We at Bright Side are well aware of the phrase “behind every successful man there is a woman” but we were happy to finally see scientific research that backs this up.

And finally, a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> published by&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon University has brought this to&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientific level. It&nbsp;claims that husbands (and wives) who have supportive spouses have a&nbsp;higher chance of&nbsp;succeeding in&nbsp;life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0d/40c/41437f5210bee5fcd083b4cb67.jpg><p>163 couples took part in&nbsp;an&nbsp;experiment where people were offered a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;either solve an&nbsp;easy puzzle or&nbsp;challenge themselves and try to&nbsp;win a&nbsp;prize. After making the offer, researchers watched and recorded the way the couples interacted with each other before making their decision. There were participants whose spouses kept encouraging them to&nbsp;choose the option to&nbsp;compete for a&nbsp;prize, while there were also those whose spouses were unconfident or&nbsp;even discouraging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fe/d4c/1f3c9d512db8e6bd1c8abda0ff.jpg><p>Moreover, researchers checked in&nbsp;on&nbsp;the same couples 6&nbsp;months later and found out that those who accepted the challenge to&nbsp;compete for a&nbsp;prize, experienced more personal growth and claimed to&nbsp;have more <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> and well-being than those who refused.</p><p><h2>Being pragmatic is&nbsp;important too.</h2></p><p>That’s not the only study on&nbsp;this topic. Researchers at&nbsp;Washington University in&nbsp;St. Louis have also conducted <a href=#>research</a> to&nbsp;prove that a&nbsp;person’s success doesn’t just depend on&nbsp;themselves&nbsp;— their spouse plays a&nbsp;huge role as&nbsp;well. They call “partner conscientiousness” and pragmatism the key elements in&nbsp;the second spouses’ success.</p><p><h2>Celebs know it&nbsp;better!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9d/d47/36db275b84abd824c818a20592.jpg><p>There are many examples among celebrities and great leaders who have publicly confessed that their spouses played a&nbsp;major role in&nbsp;their success. In&nbsp;his 2017 Harvard commencement speech, <a href=# title="Mark Zuckerberg" data-link=tag>Mark Zuckerberg</a>, for example, mentioned that his wife Priscilla inspired him to&nbsp;volunteer his time in&nbsp;social work and <a href=#>added</a> that she was the most important person in&nbsp;his life, so&nbsp;you could say it&nbsp;was the most important thing he&nbsp;built in&nbsp;his time there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b3/d0d/2576cc5a348bb8c0922c633352.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, it’s not just about supportive wives. Beyoncé also calls her husband “supportive on&nbsp;so&nbsp;many levels,” as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the one who “gives her the proper foundation.” In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, the Grammy-winning artist <a href=#>said</a> she wouldn’t be&nbsp;the woman she was if&nbsp;she “didn’t go&nbsp;home to&nbsp;that man.”</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, our life is&nbsp;more than challenging ourselves in&nbsp;puzzles, but do&nbsp;you ever feel that it&nbsp;becomes much easier to&nbsp;challenge yourself when your partner supports you?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in January 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL%2Bmv8SaqZygXai1sMPSZquhmaRirm65wKeqZqulmLCmv9Jmm56olaOxtHnOp2StoJVixLC5wKdkoZ1doq6zvsieqmaZnpl6t7XCnmSvnaKorm6DmG5ocmlf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
