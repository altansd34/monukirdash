When a&nbsp;new <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> arrives, parents experience immense joy and anticipation. That’s precisely how Supatra’s mom and dad, Sompon and Samrerng, felt upon her arrival.</p><p>Yet, their joy was tinged with astonishment, apprehension, and disbelief as&nbsp;the <a href=# title=doctor data-link=tag>doctor</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>informed</a> them that their newborn had huge hair. Initially assuming it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;ordinary, their shock deepened when they saw her in&nbsp;the incubator. <strong>Supatra’s hair covered nearly every inch of&nbsp;her body,</strong> and even the medical professionals in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Thailand data-link=tag>Thailand</a> had never encountered someone with such a&nbsp;unique appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dae/8e0/b13d9752bd938f046784229577.jpg><p>Later, doctors discovered that Natty had an&nbsp;exceptionally rare skin condition known as<i>&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ambras syndrome</i></a>. <strong>This disorder is&nbsp;so&nbsp;unusual that only </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>50&nbsp;cases</strong></a><strong> similar to&nbsp;hers have been documented worldwide over a&nbsp;long period</strong>.</p><p><h2><i>Ambras syndrome</i> leads to&nbsp;excessive body hair growth, leaving only the palms, soles, and the inside of&nbsp;the mouth unaffected. A&nbsp;sudden change in&nbsp;DNA likely causes this.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4a/213/89ddeb5749a7ce0c1fe5c3a6ac.jpg><p>Upon Natty’s birth, as&nbsp;her mom prepared to&nbsp;leave the hospital, <strong>the doctors were reluctant to&nbsp;release her, concerned she might abandon the child</strong>. Sompon reassured the doctor in&nbsp;response, affirming her commitment never to&nbsp;leave her child behind. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>emphasized</a>, “We&nbsp;are lucky that she was born into our family.”</p><p>From her early years, <strong>Natty experienced the warmth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving family</strong>. However, not everyone understood her condition, and she had to&nbsp;confront unkindness from strangers and peers as&nbsp;she grew&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f53/bbe/7ac041547496379077d484fcc9.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Natty progressed through her childhood, her face stayed concealed beneath a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;hair, a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;her incurable<i> Ambras syndrome</i>. Traditional approaches like laser removal proved ineffective in&nbsp;slowing down her hair growth. In&nbsp;school, <strong>she encountered mockery because of&nbsp;her distinctive appearance</strong>, enduring taunts such as&nbsp;“wolf girl” and “monkey face” from her peers.</p><p>Nevertheless, Natty couldn’t comprehend the reason behind their teasing. In&nbsp;her eyes, <strong>she saw herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular girl</strong> with a&nbsp;bit more hair. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “It’s the way I&nbsp;am.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/722/ef4/4ff519557c9d11fbd4834ddfd1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, Natty’s teacher, Kuljira Posaeng, disclosed that other kids were initially<strong> intimidated by&nbsp;Natty’s looks</strong>, making her early school days quite tough. But as&nbsp;time passed, Natty showed she was just like any other student.<strong> Teachers praised her for being diligent with impressive grades</strong>, and she eventually became one of&nbsp;the most popular kids in&nbsp;school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f7/b50/f7e5905c29985a0db03aca22a4.jpg><p>Her teachers described her as&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;vibrant girl passionate about singing, dancing, and acting</strong>. Her parents treated her just like any other child, never making her feel less important. They took her everywhere and<strong> were not ashamed or&nbsp;embarrassed by&nbsp;her distinct appearance</strong> compared to&nbsp;other kids.</p><p><h2>Eventually, Natty discovered love in&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a8/520/fc45de5489a4e4be16b8192daa.jpg><p>Natty has accepted her condition, recognizing that there’s no&nbsp;cure for&nbsp;it. <strong>She embraced the natural growth of&nbsp;her body hair, </strong>maintaining it&nbsp;as&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been since birth, only shaving her face when she entered her teenage years. As&nbsp;she matured,<strong> her self-esteem and self-image became increasingly significant</strong>, and she also discovered love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f91/001/b0716155138c43af3aa7246c3e.jpg><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, <strong>“It&nbsp;began from friendship, then we&nbsp;became a&nbsp;couple.” </strong>Their conversations brought her joy, and being together felt natural, with a&nbsp;love she hadn’t anticipated: “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;love that&nbsp;I didn’t expect would happen to&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Later on, Natty married her boyfriend, referring to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;“the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e75/91b/1278c55e1d9ed2531ac982a294.png><p>Natty shared images with her significant other, revealing her face without facial hair. This sparked speculation among some that she might have been cured. However, her dad clarified that <strong>she chose to&nbsp;shave her facial hair to&nbsp;showcase her new look</strong>. Presently, her eyes, face, mouth, lips, and cheeks are visible, with only her forehead covered by&nbsp;the hair on&nbsp;her head.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c6/759/91ab69519d970ffca7ce46e2da.jpg><p>Having discovered love and happiness, Natty is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;living a&nbsp;positive life and continuing to&nbsp;positively impact society. She believes that everyone is&nbsp;beautiful and unique in&nbsp;their own way. <strong>Her goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;inspire others to&nbsp;embrace their individuality and radiate their inner beauty.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bc/212/3bb7f55e9fb6e06d1ac51168b1.jpg><p>As&nbsp;you wrap&nbsp;up, make sure to&nbsp;delve into another article where a&nbsp;woman whose<strong> hips have tripled in&nbsp;size after giving birth to&nbsp;8&nbsp;kids</strong> has gone through surgery to&nbsp;get her old body back.
