Rodrigo’s piano ballad is the lead single of her sophomore album GUTS.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Olivia Rodrigo Releases Newest Breakup Single “Vampire”</h2><p>Last Friday at midnight, Rodrigo finally put out the highly-anticipated single. “Vampire” is released alongside an accompanying visualizer, serving as a kickoff of her second <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">album</a>. The “deja vu” singer began writing the “dynamic” song on the piano back in December 2022 and finished it earlier this year.</p><p>“Writing this song helped me sort through lots of feelings of regret, anger, and heartache,” she wrote on Instagram. “It’s one of my favorite songs on the album and it felt very cathartic to finish. i’m so happy it’s in your hands now and I hope it helps u deal with any bloodsuckers in your life. all my thanks 4ever.”</p><p>In her announcement on Instagram, Rodrigo included a slideshow of snaps from the “Vampire” music video. The series of images started with a close-up pic that revealed two neck bites. It was then followed by a series of behind-the-scenes of the song’s creative process.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GUTS</a> is scheduled to be released on September 8. According to Rodrigo, she had the album title in mind back when she was still making SOUR.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Speculate The Song is About Her Ex Adam Faze</h2><p>Upon listening to the whole song, some fans were convinced that Rodrigo is pertaining to her past love affair with film producer Adam Faze. The idea was brought about by her supporters after analyzing the single’s lyrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Seemingly, “Vampire” speaks of an age difference in a six-month romance. Furthermore, the song’s release date was exactly two years after Rodrigo and Faze’s attendance at the Space Jam 2 premiere.&nbsp;</p><p>“How do you lie without flinching? / Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, f—ed up little thrill / Can’t figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will / Went for me and not her / ‘Cause girls your age know better,” the lyrics goes.</p><p>However, despite present assumptions, an insider close to Rodrigo claimed that the breakup song “isn’t about Rodrigo.” Meanwhile, some fans speculate that the piano ballad can also be about her other ex Zack Bia.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vampire-vouches-rodrigo-s-brilliant-songwriting>“Vampire” Vouches Rodrigo’s Brilliant Songwriting</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grammy Award winner</a> has proven that she’s a force to be reckoned with her debut album, attracting millions of fans worldwide. Now, with “Vampire,” Rodrigo did not disappoint. Clearly, Rodrigo has gone beyond her sweet and dainty lead roles in Disney and turned into a clever and promising singer-songwriter.</p><p>In the rock opera-inspired track, the “good 4 u” hitmaker bravely expressed her rage and regret over a seemingly rueful romance. While the vibe of the song did not completely shy away from her SOUR era, it’s not something to complain about. If anything, Rodrigo has simply carved her name once more in the pop music arena.</p><p>During its debut, “Vampire” topped the US chart with 3,912,881 million opening day American streams. Moreover, it ruled the Global Chart with 9,794,245 opening day Spotify streams. With GUTS’ fire start amid the impressive release of its lead single, September will perhaps be an Olivia Rodrigo-fused month.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_RitaOra_Lisa-Maree-WilliamsGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Rita Ora’s New Single ‘Don’t Think Twice’ is Energetic, Filled With Romance Tones" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>olivia rodrigo</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>single</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqWgr6GRYr%2BwsNGinqirXauurrzIq5xmoaNirm60wKubZqCZqcGqusZmna6qmaTCtHnCqKSempGYuHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
