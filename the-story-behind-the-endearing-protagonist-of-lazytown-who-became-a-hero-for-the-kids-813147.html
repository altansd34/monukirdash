Both of&nbsp;them had to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;discipline that was totally new to&nbsp;the other, and they had three years to&nbsp;master&nbsp;it. His partner chose <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aerobic gymnastics</a> for him, and Magnús ended up&nbsp;becoming the Scandinavian champion in&nbsp;1993 and the European champion in&nbsp;1994 and 1995.</p><p><h2>How <i>LazyTown </i>came to&nbsp;be</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;the 1990s, Magnús devoted himself to&nbsp;developing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sportsperson, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;motivational speaker. He&nbsp;became well known, especially among parents, who consulted him on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;raise healthy children. So&nbsp;in&nbsp;1991, inspired by&nbsp;his own children, he&nbsp;reinvented himself as&nbsp;Sportacus, the active, <a href=#>fruit</a> and fiber-loving savior of&nbsp;LazyTown.</p><p>It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;this point that he&nbsp;started doing market research for his show. He&nbsp;realized that children’s shows often have low budgets, which is&nbsp;reflected in&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;the product. Magnús was determined to&nbsp;change this. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “When you are a&nbsp;child, your senses are alert, and you have a&nbsp;finely tuned perception of&nbsp;quality.”</p><p><h2>Over the years, Sportacus has sought to&nbsp;encourage children to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more active.</h2></p><p>From the second half of&nbsp;the 1990s onward, Magnús began a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;actions in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;focused his work on&nbsp;children. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>He&nbsp;published</a> a&nbsp;book aimed at&nbsp;this audience, explaining the importance of&nbsp;an&nbsp;active and <a href=# title="healthy lifestyle" data-link=tag>healthy lifestyle</a>, which was later adapted into a&nbsp;play where Sportacus appears for the first time. From that point&nbsp;on, <i>LazyTown</i> became very popular with children in&nbsp;<a href=#>Iceland</a>, his homeland, to&nbsp;the point where, in&nbsp;2003, he&nbsp;was asked by&nbsp;Nickelodeon to&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;television series based on&nbsp;his characters.</p><p>In&nbsp;the years that followed, the show became very popular with children’s audiences around the world. When Scheving was asked why he&nbsp;thought his show was so&nbsp;successful, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;said</a>: “<i>LazyTown</i> means different things for different audiences. For girls, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;music show, and for boys, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;action show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b92/0a2/cf403958a0b98e961c6fa33d9f.jpg><p>And many children not only enjoy watching the program but aspire to&nbsp;become Sportacus. For Magnús, this is&nbsp;very rewarding and gives him a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;satisfaction. “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;really nice because when&nbsp;I travel round the world kids show me&nbsp;their moves, they jump around and do&nbsp;pushups. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel and there were 100 kids in&nbsp;the lobby showing me&nbsp;their movements, so&nbsp;it’s fantastic,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;said</a>.</p><p><h2>His character goes beyond the screen.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d5/5f5/8e920555f9ad756ddb8bb637b8.jpg><p>Magnús has dedicated many of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> posts to&nbsp;promoting a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle and having a&nbsp;positive mind. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes</a> that positive people who don’t give&nbsp;up, despite the odds, are the real heroes. He&nbsp;also really enjoys doing different activities. “I&nbsp;feel like the best way to&nbsp;keep myself young is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep challenging myself,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;says</a>.</p><p><h2>Life after Sportacus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf6/08b/98a38b5e18a56ba923a3947e0b.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;denying that the work Magnús did for children’s health through <i>LazyTown</i> is&nbsp;memorable. However, all good things must come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;2014, Scheving announced that he&nbsp;would stop playing Sportacus in&nbsp;any kind of&nbsp;event once the show ended. Moreover, he&nbsp;was selling his production company.</p><p>But that wasn’t all&nbsp;— in&nbsp;2016, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;open a&nbsp;Scandinavian food restaurant called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ROK</a>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Currently</a>, he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;give lectures related to&nbsp;creativity and leadership to&nbsp;large audiences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWKvprTIp5tmrJiaeqa6w56Yq6GenHqxvs6tmKCnnp7AtXnOn2SlmaquwbDDzWauoaddl7KkrcyeZJplmJq%2FsHnFqKlmrJiaeqy1w6xkcWljZoF4ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
