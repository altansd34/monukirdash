Your answer to that question might depend on what your definition of “English” is, since there are so many dialects of the English language. 
Two of the most common types are American and British English. While they’re both technically the same language, there are tons of differences between the two. 
In this article, we’re going to look at the British accent vs. the American accent."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’ll also discuss some vocabulary, spelling and grammar that distinguish each of these dialects.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-are-British-and-American-English-different-from-one-another?>How are British and American English different from one another?</h2><p>As we mentioned above, there are lots of factors that make British and American English different. The most obvious one is the accent—specifically with sounds like “r” and certain vowel sounds, such as /ɒ/ vs. /ɑ/, in words like “pop” and “stop.” American and British accents also differ in intonation.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of pronunciation, American English spelling differs from British English spelling. They don’t always use the same words for various items, either (think truck vs. lorry). Finally, certain grammatical structures are different as well.</p><p>Let’s take a look at all of this in more detail!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=British-vs.-American-pronunciation>British vs. American pronunciation</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Consonant sounds</h3><p>Below, we’ll discuss two of the most obvious consonant differences when it comes to American vs. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English accents</a>.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The /r/ sound</h4><p>When you hear a British person speak and then compare that to an American’s speech, the first thing you’ll probably notice is that they <a href=#>treat “r</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">” sounds very differently</a>. In British English, when an “r” comes after a vowel in the same syllable, it’s not pronounced—this would be in words like “far,” “enter,” “market” and “injure.” On the other hand, Americans use the rhotic accent, meaning the “r” is pronounced strongly.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>The /t/ sound</h4><p>In American English, something happens to the /t/ sound when it comes after a stressed vowel and before a weak one: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it turns into a combination of a “t” and a “d.”</a> You’ll hear this in words like “butter,” “water” and “tomato” (they sound a little like “budder,” “wadder” and “tomaydo”). On the other hand, in standard British English, the /t/ in those words would sound like a typical “t” sound. This does vary depending on the area of England, however; some Brits use a glottal stop, meaning the /t/ isn’t really pronounced at all (“tomah-o,” for instance).&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Vowel sounds</h3><p>In addition to the consonants, there are some vowel sounds that are quite different between American and British English. Here are some of the main differences.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>/ɒ/ vs. /ɑ/&nbsp;</h4><p>In British English, words like “dog,” “stop” and “pot” are pronounced with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">/ɒ/ sound</a>, using<strong> </strong>a slightly rounded mouth; it’s called an “open back rounded vowel.” In American English, the /ɑ/ (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the short “o”</a>) sound is an “open back unrounded long sound”: the mouth is not rounded and is slightly more open.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>[ƏU] vs. [oʊ]&nbsp;</h4><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The British [ƏU]</a> (the “o” sound) is a diphthong, meaning it’s a combination of two vowel sounds—the mouth actually changes position when pronouncing the British “o.” This sound starts in the center of the mouth. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The American [oʊ]</a> is also a diphthong, but it starts at the back of the mouth; the lips and tongue are very tense for this sound. You’ll find these sounds in words like “go,” “slow” and “quote.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Intonation</h3><p>Another difference you’ll notice between British and American English is the intonation speakers use in a sentence, or the way they make their voice rise and fall. American English speakers, in general, tend to have a fairly flat, monotonous intonation. Conversely, British speakers often vary their tone a lot, going from high to low.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=British-vs.-American-spelling>British vs. American spelling</h2><p>Aside from the pronunciation variations we’ve gone through, British English and American English have different spelling conventions as well.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-or vs. -our</h3><p>In American English, words like “favorite,” “flavor,” “savor” and “endeavor” are always spelled with just an “or.” However, those same words in British English need to include a “u”: “favourite,” “flavour,” “savour” and “endeavour.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-ize vs. -ise</h3><p>In American English, you’ll see many words ending with “ize,” such as “organize,” “realize” and “capitalize.” In British English, those words replace the “z” with an “s”: “organise,” “realise” and “capitalise.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-yze vs. -yse</h3><p>Some words, like “analyze” and “paralyze,” always end with “yze” in American English. The same words, however, end with “yse” in British English (“analyse” and “paralyse”).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-ice vs. -ise</h3><p>American English uses “ice” at the end of the word “practice,” regardless of whether it’s a noun or a verb. In British English, the verb is spelled “practise,” but the noun is spelled “practice.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-se vs. -ce</h3><p>“Offense,” “defense” and “license” are all American spellings. But in England, you’d see these words spelled “offence,” “defence” and “licence.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-l- vs. -ll-</h3><p>When a word with a single “l” is changed into an -ed or -ing form, the spelling usually doesn’t change in American English. For example, “travel” becomes “traveled”/”traveling”; “cancel” becomes “canceled”/”canceling.” In British English, the “l” doubles, so you’d get “travelled”/”travelling” and “cancelled”/”cancelling.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-er vs. -re</h3><p>You’ll find that in American English, some words end in “er” like “center,” “fiber” and “liter.” But the letters are reversed in British English, making “centre,” “fibre” and “litre.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>-og vs. -ogue&nbsp;</h3><p>“Catalog,” “dialog” and “epilog” are all examples of American English words. Their British counterparts are “catalogue,” “dialogue” and “epilogue.”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=British-vs.-American-vocabulary>British vs. American vocabulary</h2><p>When a British English speaker and an American speaker have a conversation, they’ll probably understand most of what the other person is saying. However, there are some terminology differences that can present a challenge. Check out a few examples of what Americans and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British people say</a> differently.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>American English</strong></td><td><strong>British English</strong></td></tr><tr><td>apartment</td><td>flat</td></tr><tr><td>attorney</td><td>barrister/solicitor</td></tr><tr><td>candy</td><td>sweets</td></tr><tr><td>college</td><td>university</td></tr><tr><td>cookie</td><td>biscuit</td></tr><tr><td>eggplant</td><td>aubergine</td></tr><tr><td>elevator</td><td>lift</td></tr><tr><td>gas</td><td>petrol</td></tr><tr><td>hood</td><td>bonnet</td></tr><tr><td>parking lot</td><td>car park</td></tr><tr><td>soccer</td><td>football</td></tr><tr><td>sprinkles</td><td>hundreds and thousands</td></tr><tr><td>truck</td><td>lorry</td></tr><tr><td>trunk</td><td>boot</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=British-vs.-American-grammar>British vs. American grammar</h2><p>For the most part, British and American grammar are pretty similar. But there are a few different features that are worth mentioning.
