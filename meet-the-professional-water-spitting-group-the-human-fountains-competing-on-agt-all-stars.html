Previously, they were known as La Fontane Umane, which is Italian for their current group’s name. The group is comprised of members Ben Tillis, Joel Lowinger, Sam Kaufman, Elan Leftin, and Cameron Poter.</p><p>The group made their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT season 13</a> debut in the premiere episode at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. The Human Fountains shocked the crowd and judges with a synchronized water-spitting act that incorporated ridiculous elements such as spitting streams of water into other group members’ mouths.</p><p>They successfully made it to the Judge Cuts where they got eliminated but returned as a Wild Card in the Quarterfinals. Apart from spitting water, the Human Fountains are also highly capable of spewing other liquids from their mouths. They have also spewed orange juice, raw eggs, ketchup, and mustard from their mouths during performances.</p><p>Although their act is for comedic purposes, the group successfully tells a unique and entertaining story with each of their performances. They are a fun act to witness for people that have a great sense of humor and enjoy a great laugh.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Have They Been Up To After AGT?</h2><p>The Human Fountains were invited to perform on a variety of international <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television shows</a> following their appearance on AGT. Among these were iUmor on Antena One, France’s Got Talent, Czechia Slovakia’s Got Talent, and Das Supertalent.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Human Fountains</a> announced their first non-televised theatrical performances on stage in Los Angeles in 2019. They appeared at venues such as the Lyric Hyperion and the Actors Company Theatre. These live performances culminated in a summer exhibition of five acts for the Hollywood Fringe Festival, which earned favorable feedback from internet reviews.</p><p>More so than their other social media profiles, the group has found success with a huge audience on TikTok. They post more frequently on the video-sharing platform where they accumulated more than a million followers.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RubyCastro_DanceTownFamily-220x147.jpg alt="Why Dance Town Family is The Ultimate Throwback Group For ‘AGT’ Fans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJuvNGonZ6ro568r63LZq6arJWnerS8yK2roqaXYrSzu9SpZK2glWK1trnAp2Sfp6WjwaK1zaxknKedpbK1tc2gZKimXZa0tXnApaNmq6SWv7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
