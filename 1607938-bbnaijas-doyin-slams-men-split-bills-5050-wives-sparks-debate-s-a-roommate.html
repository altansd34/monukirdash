Read what some of them had to say about it below:</p><p class=align-left>Ossybrown:</p>“The problem is not women supporting their husbands financially up to 50% or more; rather it’s men seeking it and making it her duty. The financial support of a woman is an added blessing. Be a Man. Take charge and take care!”<p class=align-left>Arikeeee_:</p>“She’s low key saying the fact tho but low value men will find that offensive 😂.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4d8478655c54108e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tonto Dikeh reacts to video after police invited her for questioning: “Na fraudster wan arrest me?”</span></p></a><p class=align-left>seunseanjimoh1:</p>“Only unmarried women say these things.”<p class=align-left>Ossybrown:</p>“Honestly, she’s not wrong!”<p class=align-left>Lilcyl:</p>“Are there really men asking for actual 50/50? From my understanding all men want is a little support here and there and y’all tagged it as 50/50.”<p class=align-left>wanqueenmerry:</p>“Lol .. ladies comment are funny.. Growing up I watched my dad paid all the bills in the house. my mum is a business woman we thought she wasn’t contributing to the house that she just spend her money on her self to look good.. until now I got close to her and she told me things and I just started respecting her .. and she do advise me if you have money don’t let your husband know you can assist but don’t let him know.. that all I will say the fact most of our mothers are humble they don’t brag doesn’t mean they didn’t support our fathers.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/170c62eee79b8d96.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lady speaks on her first Air Peace flight from London to Lagos, shares experience on food</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chiinaazaa:</p>“I am not doing 50/50 with any man not this life not ever ….
