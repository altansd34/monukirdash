She has established herself as one of the most sort after plus-size models in the USA.</p><h3>How old is Erica Lauren?</h3><p class=align-left>The plus-size model has not revealed much about her personal life. As a result, Erica Lauren's age is unknown. She was, however, born on 17th April. On her 2021 birthday, she celebrated by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posting a photo</a> of herself rocking a black swimsuit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/19eff7560154281d.png><p class=align-left>Her sister's name is Stacey McNeill.</p><p class=align-left>The star has a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mixed ethnic background</a>. During one of her Q&A sessions on her Instagram page, she stated that she is half Black, half Italian, Irish, French and English.</p><h3>Childhood and educational background</h3><p class=align-left>The plus-size model had a pretty normal childhood. Erica was very active in sports as well as in extra-curricular activities. While in middle school, she took part in volleyball and music.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3153e52103d79653.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Cummings’ biography: age, height, ethnicity, net worth, college</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>beautiful model</a> was also part of the Pasadena Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Los Angeles Children’s Choir. Despite Lauren's love for music from a young age, she is no longer as active as she used to be. However, she still loves to sing and play the upright classical bass.</p><p class=align-left>Her bubbly personality may trick one into thinking that she is an extrovert. However, this is not the case. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was once asked</a> about the one thing she wished her fans knew about her, and this is what she had to say:</p>That I’m shy! Here and there I will acknowledge on social media that I'm an introvert, but that doesn’t necessarily equate to being shy! But I am both — not as much as I was when I was little, but I think it’s good to know that you can have a career in entertainment and social media, even if you’re not a natural extrovert! Give yourself the chance and your growth will surprise you. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b2b37aae3893e701.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Model Ella Rose’s biography: age, baby, partner, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Erica's love for music saw her enroll at the University of Southern California.
