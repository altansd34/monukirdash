Fans will remember the singer as the Wild Card pick during Season 19 of the singing competition. Madison finished in the Top 12.</strong></p><p>The cover art to Madison’s latest single is a vulnerable image as she stares off into the abyss while showing fans a more relaxed look than her signature big curly hair. Viewers have known that the singer is able to pull at the heart strings of listeners. Madison’s Idol audition was a tear jerker. She performed her original song “Daddy’s Little Girl” as a tribute to her father.</p><p>Now the singer’s latest single comes just in time for her first performance of 2022. Madison will be performing at the Live Nation backed concert Breaking Sound at The Peppermint Club. The Fayetteville, Arkansas, native will join other up-and- coming singers in Los Angeles this March.</p><p>“Lose to Love” is a timely record as Madison enters a lane that singers like Demi Lovato once occupied but have recently abandoned. She joins the list of other Idol alums who use the moment to prove their vocal abilities through personal lyrics on a daunting track. Most recently Season 19 breakout stars Benson Boone and Hunter Metts have taken this approach.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-madison-watkins-is-not-giving-up-on-her-singing-dreams>Madison Watkins is Not Giving Up on Her Singing Dreams</h2><p>Madison released her first EP Glow in 2016. She put out her second EP Rooted in 2020. She has also released the single “Blinded,” along with a retro music video inspired by&nbsp;Flashdance. On “Lose to Love” the singer puts emphasis on her piano as well as songwriting abilities.</p><p>The hair model has been open about her struggle to find support while she pursues her singing career. Madison has said that there were times when she felt like giving up. She found encouragement through her desire to perform in front of American Idol’s original judge Simon Cowell. Madison fulfilled that dream when she auditioned for America’s Got Talent in 2016.</p><p>With Idol Season 20 currently airing, if Madison’s latest single makes a splash, she can expect to get the call to return for a <a href=#>homecoming performance</a> of “Lose to Love.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1235516560.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez, John Legend to Perform at iHeartRadio Music Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Madison Watkins</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlnZaxqr%2FOp2SwmaSgtq%2B%2FjKucpZ2RqLK0eceemKuskqeyorfIp55mmpGhuaKwjKWmrJ1dqbxuuM6vnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
